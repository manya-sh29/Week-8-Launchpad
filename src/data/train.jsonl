{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "The interactive environment is VERY helpful for a programmer. However, it seems Go does not provide it.  Is my understanding correct?", "output": "No, Go does not provide a REPL(read–eval–print loop).\nHowever, as already mentioned, Go Playground is very handy. The Go Authors are also thinking about adding a feature-rich editor to it.\nIf you want something local, consider installing hsandbox. Running it simply with hsandbox go will split your terminal screen (with screen) where you can write code at the top and see its execution output at the bottom on every save.\nThere was a gotry among standard Go commands, which used to evaluate expressions (with an optional package name), and could be run like gotry 1+2 and gotry fmt 'Println(\"hello\")' from shell. It is no longer available because not many people actually used it.\nI have also seen third party projects for building a REPL for Go, but now I can only find links to two of them: igo and go-repl. How well do they work I don't know.\nMy two cents: Speed of compilation makes writing a REPL possible for Go, as it has also helped building the tools mentioned here, but the same speed makes REPL less necessary. Every time I want to test something in Go that I can't run in Playground I open a simple .go file and start coding and simply run the code. This will be even easier when the go command in Go 1 makes one-command build process possible and way easier.\nUPDATE: Latest weekly release of Go added go command which can be used to very easily build a file: write your prog.go file and run go build prog.go && ./prog\nUPDATE 2: With Go 1 you can directly run go programs with go run filename.go\nUPDATE 3: gore is a new project which seems interesting."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm interested in adding semi-colon insertion ala Google Go to my flex file.\nFrom the Go documentation:\n\nSemicolons\nLike C, Go's formal grammar uses semicolons to terminate statements;\n  unlike C, those semicolons do not appear in the source. Instead the\n  lexer uses a simple rule to insert semicolons automatically as it\n  scans, so the input text is mostly free of them.\nThe rule is this. If the last token before a newline is an identifier\n  (which includes words like int and float64), a basic literal such as a\n  number or string constant, or one of the tokens\nbreak continue fallthrough return ++ -- ) }\n\nthe lexer always inserts a semicolon after the token. This could be\n  summarized as, “if the newline comes after a token that could end a\n  statement, insert a semicolon”.\nA semicolon can also be omitted immediately before a closing brace, so\n  a statement such as\ngo func() { for { dst <- <-src } }()\n\nneeds no semicolons. Idiomatic Go programs have semicolons only in\n  places such as for loop clauses, to separate the initializer,\n  condition, and continuation elements. They are also necessary to\n  separate multiple statements on a line, should you write code that\n  way.\nOne caveat. You should never put the opening brace of a control\n  structure (if, for, switch, or select) on the next line. If you do, a\n  semicolon will be inserted before the brace, which could cause\n  unwanted effects. Write them like this\nif i < f() {\n    g()\n}\n\nnot like this\nif i < f()  // wrong! \n{           // wrong!\n    g()     // wrong!\n}           // wrong!\n\n\nHow would I go about doing this (how can I insert tokens in the stream, how can I see the last token that was matched to see if it is a good idea, etc etc etc)?\nI am using bison too, but Go seems to just use their lexer for semicolon insertion.", "output": "You could pass lexer result tokens through a function that inserts semicolons where necessary. Upon detection of the need to insert, the next token can be put back to the input stream, basically lexing it again in the next turn.\nBelow is an example that inserts a SEMICOLON before a newline, when it follows a WORD. The bison file \"insert.y\" is this:\n%{\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid yyerror(const char *str) {\n  printf(\"ERROR: %s\\n\", str);\n}\n\nint main() {\n  yyparse();\n  return 0;\n}\n%} \n%union {\n  char *string;\n}\n%token <string> WORD\n%token SEMICOLON NEWLINE\n%%\ninput: \n     | input WORD          {printf(\"WORD: %s\\n\", $2); free($2);}\n     | input SEMICOLON     {printf(\"SEMICOLON\\n\");}\n     ;\n%%\n\nand the lexer is generated by flex from this:\n%{\n#include <string.h>\n#include \"insert.tab.h\"\nint f(int token);\n%}\n%option noyywrap\n%%\n[ \\t]          ;\n[^ \\t\\n;]+     {yylval.string = strdup(yytext); return f(WORD);}\n;              {return f(SEMICOLON);}\n\\n             {int token = f(NEWLINE); if (token != NEWLINE) return token;}\n%%\nint insert = 0;\n\nint f(int token) {\n  if (insert && token == NEWLINE) {\n    unput('\\n');\n    insert = 0;\n    return SEMICOLON;\n  } else {\n    insert = token == WORD;\n    return token;\n  }\n}\n\nFor input \nabc def\nghi\njkl;\n\nit prints\nWORD: abc\nWORD: def\nSEMICOLON\nWORD: ghi\nSEMICOLON\nWORD: jkl\nSEMICOLON\n\nUnputting a non-constant token requires a little extra work - I have tried to keep the example simple, just to give the idea."}

This means there could be many active connections (http, websockets, data streaming).\nI like things about the other platforms mentioned, but D is much more generalized. If it isn't too clunky, I would choose D over the others.", "output": "There's nothing exactly equivalent but there are two modules that may provide something similar enough for your needs:\n\nstd.concurrency provides message passing and guaranteed isolation unless the shared qualifier is used to gain very limited, explicit shared memory.  However, you don't (yet) get the multiplexing of fibers onto threads that goroutines provide.  Right now, every call to spawn starts a new OS thread.  Also, there's still some work to be done to make immutability usable enough to make this paradigm reach its full potential.  For more on this paradigm, see the free chapter of Andrei Alexandrescu's \"The D Programming Language\".\nstd.parallelism provides tasks.  It's geared towards parallelism, not concurrency.  (These are not the same thing even though you need concurrency to implement parallelism.)  Therefore, instead of message passing, a task simply executes with no communication with the calling thread and then returns its return value to the calling thread.  Additionally, if there are more tasks than threads, the excess tasks are queued, not multiplexed using fibers.\n\nEdit:  I originally designed and wrote std.parallelism and am willing to consider enhancement requests to suit needs such as yours, as long as they don't expand the scope of the module too far into general-case concurrency.  If std.parallelism does almost what you need but not quite, please post a feature request either here or on the digitalmars.d newsgroup.  \nAlso, even though I would likely not be the implementer of such a request, feel free to suggest enhancements to std.concurrency."}

When doing io your goroutines will yield and let the other goroutines run on the same thread.\nThis seem very similar to me to how the .net Async CTP feature is doing cooperative concurrency if you are not using background thread.\nMy question is which advantage or drawback could you think of one methode over the other.", "output": "Making value judgements is always a tricky thing so I'll highlight 3 differences. You decide whether they fall into the \"pro\" or \"con\" bucket.\n\nWhile both Go and async allow you to write async code in a straightforward way, in .NET you have to be aware which part of your code is async and which one isn't (i.e. you have to explicitly use async/await keywords). In Go you don't need to know that - the runtime makes it \"just work\", there is no special syntax to mark async code.\nGo design doesn't require any special code in standard library. .NET required adding new code to the standard library for every async operation, essentially doubling API surface for those cases e.g. there's new async http download API and the old, non-async http download API has to remain for backwards compatibility.\nGo design and implementation is orders of magnitude simpler. A small piece of runtime code (scheduler) takes care of suspending goroutines that block on system calls and yielding to sleeping goroutines. There is no need for any special async support in standard library.\n\n.NET implementation first required adding the aforementioned new APIs. Furthermore .NET implementation is based on compiler rewriting code with async/await into an equivalent state machines. It's very clever but also rather complicated. The practical result was that the first async CTP had known bugs while Go's implementation was working pretty much from the beginning.\nUltimately, it doesn't really matter. async/await is the best way to write async code in .NET. Goroutines are the best way to get that in Go. Both are great, especially compared to alternatives in most other languages."}

Now I'm really confused about how on earth this works.\nIf I have more than one methods on a type, how do I know which one is going to be attached to the new instance and with what name or order?", "output": "This approach allows you to use a function in a context that's expecting a Handler.\nWhat happens is, there's a Handler interface:\n    type Handler interface {\n        ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)\n    }\n\nand various functions are declared to accept parameters that are declared to belong to this interface — for example:\n    func TimeoutHandler(h Handler, ns int64, msg string) Handler {\n        f := func() <-chan int64 {\n            return time.After(ns)\n        }\n        return &timeoutHandler{h, f, msg}\n    }\n\nWhat this means is that when you invoke such a function, you have to pass in an object belonging to a type that satisfies this interface, which is to say, a type that has a ServeHTTP method with the appropriate signature. (In Go, unlike some languages, a type doesn't need to explicitly implement an interface, it just needs to have the methods specified by the interface.)\nSo, the code-snippet that you quote:\ntype HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)\nfunc (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {\n    f(w, r)\n}\n\ncreates a type HandlerFunc that's based on func(ResponseWriter, *Request), but augments the type with a method called ServeHTTP with an appropriate signature, so that it satisfies the Handler interface. This ServeHTTP method just calls the function itself. So, if f is a function with the right signature, you could write something like this:\nvar h HandlerFunc = f    // h == f, but converted to a HandlerFunc\n                         // so it satisfies the Handler interface.\nTimeoutHandler(h, 1000000, \"timed out\")\n\nTo clarify a few things about this:\n\nTesting, I discovered that if I pass a random function (foo) to the HandlerFunc:\nvar bar = HandlerFunc(foo)\nbar becomes an instance of HandlerFunc with foo as its ServeHTTP method.

(The HandlerFunc(foo) notation is a typecast; you could just as well write var bar HandlerFunc = foo and let the conversion happen implicitly.)\nSecondly, it's more correct to say that bar has a ServeHTTP method that invokes foo, than that foo itself actually is the ServeHTTP method.\nDoes that make sense?"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm trying to lay out an idea for a project, where a client-side GUI can be developed in python, and the GUI can be driven by a backend in potentially any other language, over RPC.\nMore specifically, right now I am working with PyQt on the client side, and Go as the initial backend. \nHere are my goals: \n\nPyQt client\n\nRoles: View, Controller\nOneway calls (SIGNAL/SLOT), such as: button.clicked -> RPC.handleSignal\nRequest/Reply RPC, such as: rowCount = model.rowCount -> RPC.call.model.rowCount\n\nAgnostic backend (Go in this case)\n\nRoles: Controller, Model\nOneway calls (Emit SIGNAL), such as: model.dataChanged -> RPC.emitSignal\n\n\nI refer to each of these as having controller roles becase a user could define signal/slot connections in the GUI client side, or the backend could define its own signal/slot connections over RPC, assuming knowledge about the view on the client side. It would depend solely on how the user wants to set up the controller.\nI am looking at Thrift right now, vs say a lighter weight basic rpc without an IDL. But mainly my question is whether it would be a messy approach to try and do Thrift as two .thrift files, with  client/server <----> client/server (two connections), in order to get the bi-directional functionality? The benefit I see with Thrift is the IDL, so that I can build my interface specifically, and backend code can just implement the parts they want. \nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a solution to this? Two Thrift interfaces? One Thrift interface, that provides a service to let the client establish a second simple socket to receive oneway calls from the server? Or is Thrift somewhat even overkill here? While the backend -> GUI interface is really only a single service function, the GUI -> backend could expand a bit (modelHandlers, slotHandlers, general server status queries).\n(Edit) More Thoughts\nPart of me is thinking that the pattern could be done with any RPC framework, and it would be like this?\n\nBackend server process starts; listens on port\nClient GUI starts; connects to server RPC; listens on new port; sends port to server via RPC call\nServer receives port from client, and binds to it for a second RPC connection\nClient and Server have 2 connections, for bi-directional RPC", "output": "On the network when you connect to a server via TCP (or any other similar connection based protocol), when connecting your PC already chooses and listens on a (pseudo/relatively) random port in order to receive the servers answers. So for that matter, as long as the server keeps the connection and both sides keep the connection alive you already have a bi-directional connection. So from a technical, low-level point of view you do not need to initiate a second connection.\nDepending on your RPC system it may or may not use TCP and it may or may not feature bi-directional communication (or rather, bi-directional communication initialization).\nNow, for thrift, there does not seem to be much documentation there yet (no API reference). But checking the example code it seems to abstract the connection-handling away and use request/response communication only. So in this case, yes, you would have to listen on a defined port client side and tell the server, so the server can initiate a request/response communication.\nGo itself provides the rpc package, which is exclusive to go data, so will not help you.\nHowever, it also provides the websocket package. Although initially targeted at webserver to webbrowser communications it is a bi-directional protocol (that’s what it’s about after all) and can be used by any application type. It may not be as efficient size-/bandwidth-wise but it does the job.\nI’m not sure about the state of implementation in the go package. The Conn type does have an origin field but the Conn.Dial function example passes http://localhost; I’m not sure whether this is replaced with a remotely-accessible websocket origin. The Handler.ServeHTTP function provides an http.ResponseWriter, which you can probably use to initiate connection as well. At least that’s the first thing I would test.\nAn alternative, if you are comfortable with using a defined dataformat and handle networking yourself, is protobuf. There is a community project for go bindings to protobuf. You could then handle the TCP connection yourself (connecting to it and sending your data, receiving the data, holding the connection info etc).\nAs for other alternatives, you may want to check the community packages page and or the community projects page (especially the Go Ajax and go-xmlrpc – both are very rudimentary at this point though)."}

What should I put in all the other fields, and why, to avoid any vulnerabilities? Also, can I use the same private/public key pair for both ways authentication (client to server, and server to client), or do I have to use 2 pairs?\nOr, is there something simpler than TLS that I could use?

Your best bet is creating self signed certificates using OpenSSL. However, I would then use the Go TLS library for encryption. Below is some code that may help you.\nCreating an x509 key pair\nI normally follow the instructions here. Summary of commands (do for both client and server):\nopenssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr\ncp server.key server.key.org\nopenssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt\n\nUsing Go's TLS library\nFirst, create a tls.Config. One TLS config will work on both client and server but some of the options only need to be set on one or the other:\ncert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair(cert, key)\nconfig := &tls.Config{\n    Certificates: []Certificates{cert},\n    ClientAuth: tls.RequireAnyClientCert, // Must be done on server\n    InsecureSkipVerify: true, // Must be done on client\n}\n\nOn the server, you need to setup a TLS listener.

The easiest way to do that is to give each server the public key of the other server and compare it to the server that has just connected. To find the public key on the other server, you need to:\nc := conn.(*tls.Conn) // convert net.Conn from listener to tls conn\nerr := c.Handshake() // ensure handshake is completed without error\nstate := c.ConnectionState()\npubKey, err := x509.MarshalPKIXPublicKey(state.PeerCertificates[0])\nbytes.Equal(pubKey, knownKey) // compare to known value"}

However there's a mistake in my question: I assumed cgo could also be used to access c++ code but that's not possible. Instead you need to use SWIG.\nThe go faq says \"The cgo program provides the mechanism for a “foreign function interface” to allow safe calling of C libraries from Go code. SWIG extends this capability to C++ libraries. \"\nmy question:\nIs it possible to access high-level c++ frameworks such as QT with SWIG + Go and get productive? I'd like to use Go as a \"scripting language\" to utilize c++ libraries.\nHave you any experience with go and swig? Are there pitfalls I have to be aware of?\nUpdate/Answer: I've asked this over IRC too and I think the question is solved:\nSWIG is a rather clean way of interfacing c++ code from other languages. Sadly matching the types of c++ to something like go can be very complex and in most cases you have to specify the mapping yourself. That means that SWIG is a good way to leverage an existing codebase to reuse already written algorithms. However mapping a library like Qt to go will take you ages. Mind it's surely possible but you don't want to do it.\nThose of you that came here for gui programming with go might want try go-gtk or the go version of wxWidgets.", "output": "Is it possible?  Yes.\nCan it be done in a reasonably short period of time?  No.\nIf you go back and look at other projects that have taken large frameworks and tried to put an abstraction layer on it, you'll find most are \"incomplete\".  You can probably make a fairly good start and get some initial wrappers in place, but generally even the work to get the simple cases solved takes time when there is a lot of underlying code to wrap, even with automated tools (which help, but are never a complete solution).  And then...  you get to the nasty remaining 10% that will take you forever (ok, a really really long time at least).  And then think about how it's a changing target in the first place.  Qt, for example, is about to release the next major rewrite.\nGenerally, it's safest to stick to the framework language that the framework was designed for.  Though many have language extensions within the project itself.  For example, for Qt you should check out QML, which provides (among many other things) a javascript binding to Qt.  Sort of.  But it might meet your \"scripting\" requirement."}

I was wondering the best way to do that in C.\nI have to say I am no C expert, so there might be a better way to detect a Stack Overflow on C, but giving my ignorance, here's how I thought I would implement it:\nThe first thing I thought is that every time we have a fresh new stack, we get a stack variable's address, and with that we have roughly the starting stack address. Then we would need to be able to retrieve how much stack space the thread has. This would be possible if the thread isn't the main thread, but I have no idea how we would get this info on C.\nThen we would need to check (per function call, it could be) how much of the stack is already used, by retrieving current stack variable address. If we detect a possible stack overflow, we would need to have some way to create a new stack and link to the last one. The only way I thought it could be done in C would be to create a new thread to execute the function we want, and lock the current thread until the function returns its result.\nSo, would there be a cleaner/better way to implement this?", "output": "See GCC's split-stack capability.

Two elegant, and related, solutions to this are continuations (as found in Scheme, Ruby and Smalltalk) and coroutines (as found in Python and Go).\nBruce Tate in his Beyond Java (O'Reilly, 2005) talked about Ruby on Rails and Seaside as exciting new developments in Web programming. To me, Seaside was the real breakthrough: using Smalltalk continuations, Seaside made it very easy to program complex request/response sequences. \nI know about Python coroutines being used in Tornado and Twisted to reduce callbacks, but that is somewhat low-level, compared to writing a view/controller in a single coroutine to handle a sequence of HTTP requests to complete an online purchase, for example.\nI wonder why these ideas that look so good on paper are not more widely deployed in Python and Ruby.

So I'm hoping someone can provide some clarity.\nHere are the facts that I have gathered:\n\nGo is single threaded on App Engine. - this is because it is possible to do arbitrary pointer arithmetic by creating race conditions with multiple threads\nGoroutines are multiplexed onto multiple OS threads so if one should block, such as while waiting for I/O, others continue to run.\n[App Engine has a] 10 concurrent limit [which] is enforced through a limit on concurrent threads on every runtime. Most of such cases, our scheduler will try to spin up a new instance.\n\nIf Go is single threaded on App Engine then point 3 is moot. This leaves 1 and 2. If Go on App Engine is single threaded and threads are required to continue execution while blocking for I/O, then it seems that an App Engine Go instance will block all goroutines while waiting on I/O.\nIs this correct? If not how does Go's concurrency really work on App Engine?\nTo help quantify things. If I were to hold a connection open for 30 seconds.

All goroutines will\n  // deadlock, since the range keyword will look for a close.\n  for num := range c {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Producer produced: %d\\n\", num)\n  }\n  fmt.Println(\"All done.\")\n}\n\nSo the issue is, if I close it's wrong, if I don't close - it's still wrong (see comments in code).\nNow, the solution would be an out-of-band signal channel, that ALL producers write to:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"math/rand\"\n)\n\nfunc producer(c chan int, signal chan bool) {\n  success := rand.Float32() > 0.5\n  if success {\n    c <- rand.Int()\n  }\n  signal <- true\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  c := make(chan int, 10)\n  signal := make(chan bool, 10)\n  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n    go producer(c, signal)\n  }\n\n  // This is basically a 'join'.\n  num_done := 0\n  for num_done < 10 {\n    <- signal\n    num_done++\n  }\n  close(c)\n\n  for num := range c {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Producer produced: %d\\n\", num)\n  }\n  fmt.Println(\"All done.\")\n}\n\nAnd that totally does what I want! But to me it seems like a mouthful. My question is: Is there any idiom/trick that lets me do something similar in an easier way?\nI had a look here: http://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/\nAnd it seems like the complete chan (initialised at the start of main) is used in a range but never closed. I do not understand how.\nIf anyone has any insights, I would greatly appreciate it. Cheers!\n\nEdit: fls0815 has the answer, and has also answered the question of how the close-less channel range works.\nMy code above modifed to work (done before fls0815 kindly supplied code):\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"math/rand\"\n  \"sync\"\n)\n\nvar wg_prod sync.WaitGroup\nvar wg_cons sync.WaitGroup\n\nfunc producer(c chan int) {\n  success := rand.Float32() > 0.5\n  if success {\n    c <- rand.Int()\n  }\n  wg_prod.Done()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n  c := make(chan int, 10)\n  wg_prod.Add(10)\n  for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n    go producer(c)\n  }\n\n  wg_cons.Add(1)\n  go func() {\n    for num := range c {\n      fmt.Printf(\"Producer produced: %d\\n\", num)\n    }\n    wg_cons.Done()\n  } ()\n\n  wg_prod.Wait()\n  close(c)\n  wg_cons.Wait()\n  fmt.Println(\"All done.\")\n}", "output": "Only producers should close channels. You could achieve your goal by invoking consumer(s) which iterates (range) over the resulting channel once your producers were started. In your main thread you wait (see sync.WaitGroup) until your consumers/producers finished their work. After producers finished you close the resulting channel which will force your consumers to exit (range will exit when channels are closed and no buffered item is left).\nExample code:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"log\"\n    \"sync\"\n    \"time\"\n    \"math/rand\"\n    \"runtime\"\n)\n\nfunc consumer() {\n    defer consumer_wg.Done()\n\n    for item := range resultingChannel {\n        log.Println(\"Consumed:\", item)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc producer() {\n    defer producer_wg.Done()\n\n    success := rand.Float32() > 0.5\n    if success {\n        resultingChannel <- rand.Int()\n    }\n}\n\nvar resultingChannel = make(chan int)\nvar producer_wg sync.WaitGroup\nvar consumer_wg sync.WaitGroup\n\nfunc main() {\n    rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())\n\n    for c := 0; c < runtime.NumCPU(); c++ {\n        producer_wg.Add(1)  \n        go producer()\n    }\n\n    for c := 0; c < runtime.NumCPU(); c++ {\n        consumer_wg.Add(1)\n        go consumer()\n    }\n\n    producer_wg.Wait()\n\n    close(resultingChannel)\n\n    consumer_wg.Wait()\n}\n\nThe reason I put the close-statement into the main function is because we have more than one producer. Closing the channel in one producer in the example above would lead to the problem you already ran into (writing on closed channels; the reason is that there could one producer left who still produces data). Channels should only be closed when there is no producer left (therefore my suggestion on closing the channel only by the producer). This is how channels are constructed in Go. Here you'll find some more information on closing channels.\n\nRelated to the sharemem example: AFAICS this example runs endless by re-queuing the Resources again and again (from pending -> complete -> pending -> complete... and so on). This is what the iteration at the end of the main-func does. It receives the completed Resources and re-queues them using Resource.Sleep() to pending. When there is no completed Resource it waits and blocks for new Resources being completed. Therefore there is no need to close the channels because they are in use all the time."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "Some times you could want to avoid/minimize the garbage collector, so I want to be sure about how to do it.\nI think that the next one is correct:\n\nDeclare variables at the beginning of the function.\nTo use array instead of slice.\n\nAny more?", "output": "Avoiding garbage is relatively straight forward. You need to understand where the allocations are being made and see if you can avoid the allocation.\nFirst, declaring variables at the beginning of a function will NOT help. The compiler does not know the difference. However, human's will know the difference and it will annoy them.\nUse of an array instead of a slice will work, but that is because arrays (unless dereferenced) are put on the stack. Arrays have other issues such as the fact that they are passed by value (copied) between functions. Anything on the stack is \"not garbage\" since it will be freed when the function returns. Any pointer or slice that may escape the function is put on the heap which the garbage collector must deal with at some point.\nThe best thing you can do is avoid allocation. When you are done with large bits of data which you don't need, reuse them. This is the method used in the profiling tutorial on the Go blog. I suggest reading it.\nAnother example besides the one in the profiling tutorial: Lets say you have an slice of type []int named xs. You continually append to the []int until you reach a condition and then you reset it so you can start over. If you do xs = nil, you are now declaring the underlying array of the slice as garbage to be collected. Append will then reallocate xs the next time you use it. If instead you do xs = xs[:0], you are still resetting it but keeping the old array.\nFor the most part, trying to avoid creating garbage is premature optimization. For most of your code it does not matter. But you may find every once in a while a function which is called a great many times that allocates a lot each time it is run. Or a loop where you reallocate instead of reusing. I would wait until you see the bottle neck before going overboard."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I know that Go is little different to other languages in this respect, but I wondered if it would be worthwhile for the Go language to automatically test for nil pointers on comparisons and return unequal if only one of the values is nil (in a comparison) rather than creating a run-time error. Go is so great in so many areas I just thought it might do it. The case in point is as follows:\n\ntype cuForm struct {sName string; iUseCount int64; baForm []byte}\n\nvar pugForm *cuForm\n\n//***********************************************************\nfunc loadForm (sWanted string) (*cuForm, os.Error) {\n//***********************************************************\n\n    if (sWanted == pugForm.sName) {\n\nIn the above example, if pugForm is nil, a runtime error occurs. Obviously if only one of the values is nil, it cannot be equal - logically at least. There may well be a reason why this shouldn't be done, but I don't think history should be one reason.", "output": "The error message is: \"panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference.\" The actual error is a nil pointer dereference.\nWhen the pointer pugForm is nil then pugForm.sName is undefined. You want it to be a special value like null in SQL or NaN in floating-point. Now you need a special set of rules for all operations, not just equality.\nA nil pointer dereference is almost always wrong. The runtime should object if that happens. If it's not wrong, avoid the problem by testing for nil.

However, when a struct is passed in to a function via its value, then a NEW copy of the struct is actually created just for that function call, and any modifications to this new copy of the struct will not affect the original struct.\nYou can prove that this is the way it works by printing out the actual addresses of the structs in question:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype T struct { Val string }\n\nfunc (t T) SetVal( s string ) {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Address of copy is %p\\n\", &t);\n}\n\nfunc (t *T) SetVal2( s string ) {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Pointer argument is %p\\n\", t);\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n        v := T{\"abc\"}\n        fmt.Printf(\"Address of v is %p\\n\", &v);\n        v.SetVal(\"pdq\")\n        v.SetVal2(\"xyz\")\n}\n\nThe code above results in this output when I run it in the Go playground:\nAddress of v is 0xf840001290\nAddress of copy is 0xf8400013e0\nPointer argument is 0xf840001290\n\nNotice how the first and third pointer printed out are equal, which means they are the same struct.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I am having trouble understanding the workflow for creating a go project that has local packages.\nSay I create a new project, using git for version control, which has a main.go file and a tools.go file which will be in package utils. So I have a directory structure such as this:\n/myproject/\n   main.go\n   utils/\n     tools.go\n\nmain.go looks like this:\npackage main\nimport \"./utils\"\nfunc main() {\n    utils.DoSomthing()\n}\n\nand tools.go looks like this:\npackage utils;\nfunc DoSomething() {\n}\n\nEverything works just fine locally, using go build and go run. But this is being hosted on github, and I'd like to be able to have others use the go get command to install it. So the local package import must be changed to use the format \"github.com/user/project/utils\", which works, except now I have two copies of the source code, and the real problem is that the copy with the git history has an import that makes use of the downloaded copy. So if I'm working on the copy with the git history, any changes made to tools.go will go unnoticed, because it will be using the downloaded copy.\nSo I'm wondering if someone can explain the right way of using go get, version control, and package imports within the same project.", "output": "I've just written a short step-by-step guide on how I am using the new go tool and github.com. You might find it useful:\n1. Setup your GOPATH\nYou can set the environment variable GOPATH to any directory you like. If you have larger projects, it's probably a good idea to create a different GOPATH for each of them. I would recommend this approach especially for the deployment, so that updating a library for project A doesn't break project B which might require an earlier version of the very same library.\nAlso note that you can set your GOPATH to a list of directories, delimited by colons. So you might have a GOPATH containing all commonly used packages, and separate GOPATHS for each project with additonal packages or different versions of existing packages.\nBut unless your are working on a lot of different Go projects simultaneously, its probably enough to have just a single GOPATH locally. So, let's create one:\nmkdir $HOME/gopath\n\nThen you need to set two environment variables to tell the go tool where it can find existing Go packages and where it should install new ones. It's probably best to add the following two lines to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile (and do not forget to reload your .bashrc afterwards).\nexport GOPATH=\"$HOME/gopath\"\nexport PATH=\"$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\"\n\n2. Create a new project\nIf you want to create a new Go project which should be hosted at github.com later, you should create this project under $GOPATH/src/github.com/myname/myproject. It's important that the path matches the URL of the github.com repo, because the go tool will follow the same convention. So, let's create the project root and initialize a new git repository there:\nmkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/myname/myproject\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/myname/myproject\ngit init\n\nBecause I do not like to type such long paths, I normally create symbolic links for the projects I am currently working on in my home folder:\nln -s $GOPATH/src/github.com/myname/myproject ~/myproject\n\n3. Write your application\nStart coding and don't forget to git add and git commit your files. Also, do not use relative imports like import \"./utils\" for sub-packages. They are currently undocumented and shouldn't be used at all, because they won't work with the go tool. Use imports like github.com/myname/myproject/utils instead.\n4. Publish your project\nCreate a new repository at github.com, upload your SSH public key if you haven't done that before and push your changes to the remote repository:\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:myname/myproject.git\ngit push origin master\n\n5. Continue working on your project\nIf you have set the GOPATH in your .bashrc and if you have created a symlink to your project in your home folder, you can just type cd myproject/ and edit some files there. Afterwards, you can commit the changes using git commit -a and send them to github.com by doing a git push."}

In Go, right shift is a logical shift on unsigned values and an arithmetic shift on signed values. Logical shift always rounds toward zero, while arithmetic shift always rounds down, that is, toward −∞."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I've been trying to implement the HashCash algorithm in Go! For those of you who don't know -\n\nHashCash is a method to stop spam. Basically, a header is constructed of some environment variables known both to the client and server (email, timestamp etc.). A random nonce is appended to the end of the header. The client tries to bruteforce a partial hash collision (e.g. where the first x bits are 0) by changing the nonce.\nHashCash works because it's not as expensive to find partial hash collisions. When the server receives this header, they verify the information in it (so it can be used only for one session) and compute the resulting hash. If the first x bits are 0, then a good amount of time has been expended on the client's machine, computing the collision (which wouldn't happen on a spambot)\n\nFor me, I'm just wanting to write a program which finds the time it takes for a client to find a partial hash collision of x bits.\nI wrote this code which will return true/false if the int64 has a hash collision of x bits.\nfunc partialAllZeroes (zeroCount uint8, val int64) (bool, os.Error) {\n    setBitString := \"1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\"\n    unsetBitString := \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n    setBitString = setBitString[0:zeroCount-1]\n    unsetBitString = unsetBitString[0:zeroCount-1]\n    \n    zeroTest, e := strconv.Btoi64(setBitString, 2) // 64 0bits\n    zeroes, e   := strconv.Btoi64(unsetBitString, 2) // 64 1bits\n    \n    if e != nil {\n        return false, e\n    }\n    result := val & zeroTest\n    switch {\n        case result == zeroes:\n            return true, nil\n        case result != zeroes:\n            return false, nil\n    }\n    \n    return false, os.NewError(\"\")\n}\n\nMy current problem is I'm having alot of type conversion issues. For example, I am only able to operate on the int64 type, because that's what strconv.Btoi64 returns.

It's easiest to just point to the idiomatic uses for panic/recover as opposed to try/catch &| exceptions in other languages, or the concepts behind those idioms (which can be basically summed up as \"exceptions should only occur in truly exceptional circumstances\")\nBut as to what the actual difference is between them? I'll try to summarize as best I can.\nOne of the main differences compared to try/catch blocks is the way control flows. In a typical try/catch scenario, the code after the catch block will run unless it propagates the error. This is not so with panic/recover. A panic aborts the current function and begins to unwind the stack, running deferred functions (the only place recover does anything) as it encounters them.\nReally I'd take that even further: panic/recover is almost nothing like try/catch in the sense that try and catch are (or at least act like) control structures, and panic/recover are not.\nThis really stems out of the fact that recover is built around the defer mechanism, which (as far as I can tell) is a fairly unique concept in Go.\nThere are certainly more, which I'll add if I can actuate my thoughts a bit better."}

For example between routine 1 & 3 channels are command13 & response13. routine 1 uses command13 to send int and response13 to receive int to/from routine 3.For routine 3 response13 used to send int and command13 to receive int to/from routine 1 (command/response 13 represents channel between routine 1 and 3).Now, as three routines are concurrent and they have specific routines to handle received msg or sending msg, why they go to deadlock ?", "output": "go Routine1(command12, response12,command13, response13 )\ngo Routine2(command12, response12,command23, response23) // go routine\nRoutine3(command12, response12,command23, response23 )\n\nThis will start Routine1 in a new goroutine, and the main goroutine will continue with the next statement. Therefore, Routine1 and Routine2 will be executed concurrently, but Routine3 will be started after Routine2 has finished. You might miss another \"go\" statement here.\nThen, I was trying to follow your program. In Routine1 you do\ncommand13 <- y\n\nThis will block Routine1 until there is another goroutine ready which is able to receive your message. So you need a y := <-command13 in another goroutine.\nBut now, lets look closely at the parameter of the other two goroutines:\nRoutine2(command12, response12,command23, response23)\nRoutine3(command12, response12,command23, response23 )\n\nAs you can see, none of the goroutines has access to command13 (but you are passing command12 twice). So, neither Routine1 nor Routine2 or Routine3 is able to continue. Deadlock!\nI would recommend you to go back to the drawing board. Think about what you are trying to do first, draw some diagrams about the expected flow of messages and then, try to implement that behavior.\nIt's really hard to debug your program at the moment since,\n\nI do not know what you are trying to do. There is no detailed description about the message flow or anything like that. In fact, your code doesn't contain any documentation at all.\nYou are passing channels which are called response23 to a parameter called response13 and so on. It's quite easy to mix them up.\nAll those generic names like command12 etc. make it hard to understand what this channel is supposed to do\nIt's a good idea to gofmt your source code before you post it :)\n\nAs a starting point, I can recommend you the \"Prime Numbers\" example form the Go tutorial. In this example, possible prime numbers are passed from one goroutine to another. Additionally, this example also contains some nice graphics about the message flow as well as some really good explanations. You might like it."}

Variable declarations can always be written explicitly as regular variable declarations or named function parameters; implicit short variable declarations are merely a shorthand for regular variable declarations.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\nfunc f() (err1 os.Error, err2 os.Error) {\n    var fi *os.FileInfo\n    fi, err1 = os.Stat(\"== err1 os.Error ==\")\n    _ = fi\n    {\n        var fi *os.FileInfo\n        fi, err2 = os.Stat(\"== err2 os.Error ==\")\n        _ = fi\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    err1, err2 := f()\n    fmt.Println(\"f() err1:\", err1)\n    fmt.Println(\"f() err2:\", err2)\n}\n\nOutput:\nf() err1: stat == err1 os.Error ==: no such file or directory\nf() err2: stat == err2 os.Error ==: no such file or directory\n\nIn your example, the short variable declaration of err redeclares the return parameter declaration of err; they are in the same block. Therefore, the new err does not mask the return parameter err."}

If you don't like the idea of looking this up every time, you can store this runtime type in a variable.\nOn 2, no, not really. This would require the Go runtime to maintain a map of all types in the current binary, which has a number of problems. You could create a type registry package, and register all types you may want to retrieve by string, but that's always going to be incomplete, and if you know what type you want, you can always just use TypeOf. The situation is made a bit more complicated by the fact that you can have anonymous types, and the name like \"t1\" isn't certain to be unique, as another package may have a type of the same name.

It's also possible to avoid the need for garbage collection, so you don't have to worry about unpredictable GC pauses. It's designed to integrate nicely with existing C code, and many of the data types map directly onto C types. Rust's approach to polymorphism leads to some really nice assembly once LLVM is done with it.\nMany games nowadays are running in the web browser, which suggests that web browsers and games have similar requirements.

Example:\nbuf := new(strings.Builder)\nn, err := io.Copy(buf, r)\n// check errors\nfmt.Println(buf.String())\n\n\nOUTDATED INFORMATION BELOW\nThe short answer is that it it will not be efficient because converting to a string requires doing a complete copy of the byte array. Here is the proper (non-efficient) way to do what you want:\nbuf := new(bytes.Buffer)\nbuf.ReadFrom(yourReader)\ns := buf.String() // Does a complete copy of the bytes in the buffer.\n\nThis copy is done as a protection mechanism. Strings are immutable. If you could convert a []byte to a string, you could change the contents of the string. However, go allows you to disable the type safety mechanisms using the unsafe package. Use the unsafe package at your own risk. Hopefully the name alone is a good enough warning. Here is how I would do it using unsafe:\nbuf := new(bytes.Buffer)\nbuf.ReadFrom(yourReader)\nb := buf.Bytes()\ns := *(*string)(unsafe.Pointer(&b))\n\nThere we go, you have now efficiently converted your byte array to a string. Really, all this does is trick the type system into calling it a string. There are a couple caveats to this method:\n\nThere are no guarantees this will work in all go compilers. While this works with the plan-9 gc compiler, it relies on \"implementation details\" not mentioned in the official spec. You can not even guarantee that this will work on all architectures or not be changed in gc. In other words, this is a bad idea.\nThat string is mutable! If you make any calls on that buffer it will change the string. Be very careful.\n\nMy advice is to stick to the official method. Doing a copy is not that expensive and it is not worth the evils of unsafe. If the string is too large to do a copy, you should not be making it into a string."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "The filepath.Walk function takes a function callback. This is straight function with no context pointer. Surely a major use case for Walk is to walk a directory and take some action based on it, with reference to a wider context (e.g. entering each file into a table).\nIf I were writing this in C# I would use an object (with fields that could point back to the objects in the context) as a callback (with a given callback method) on it so the object can encapsulate the context that Walk is called from.\n(EDIT: user \"usr\" suggests that the closure method occurs in C# too)\nIf I were writing this in C I'd ask for a function and a context pointer as a void * so the function has a context pointer that it can pass into the Walk function and get that passed through to the callback function.\nBut Go only has the function argument and no obvious context pointer argument.\n(If I'd designed this function I would have taken an object as a callback rather than a function, conforming to the interface FileWalkerCallback or whatever, and put a callback(...) method on that interface. The consumer could then attach whatever context to the object before passing it to Walk.)\nThe only way I can think of doing it is by capturing the closure of the outer function in the callback function. Here is how I am using it:\nfunc ScanAllFiles(location string, myStorageThing *StorageThing) (err error) {\n    numScanned = 0\n\n    // Wrap this up in this function's closure to capture the `corpus` binding.\n    var scan = func(path string, fileInfo os.FileInfo, inpErr error) (err error) {\n        numScanned ++\n\n        myStorageThing.DoSomething(path)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Scan All\")\n\n    err = filepath.Walk(location, scan)\n\n    fmt.Println(\"Total scanned\", numScanned)\n\n    return\n}\n\nIn this example I create the callback function so its closure contains the variables numScanned and myStorageThing.\nThis feels wrong to me. Am I right to think it feels weird, or am I just getting used to writing Go? How is it intended for the filepath.Walk method to be used in such a way that the callback has a reference to a wider context?", "output": "You're doing it about right.  There are two little variations you might consider.  One is that you can replace the name of an unused parameter with an underbar.  So, in your example where you only used the path, the signature could read\nfunc(path string, _ os.FileInfo, _ error) error\n\nIt saves a little typing, cleans up the code a little, and makes it clear that you are not using the parameter.  Also, for small functions especially, it's common skip assigning the function literal to a variable, and just use it directly as the argument.  Your code ends up reading,\nerr = filepath.Walk(location, func(path string, _ os.FileInfo, _ error) error {\n    numScanned ++\n\n    myStorageThing.DoSomething(path)\n})\n\nThis cleans up scoping a little, making it clear that you are using the closure just once."}

What can you do in a brief program? Show off your best example code. While the true measure of a language can't really be taken until you've written and maintained a large codebase with a team of many programmers over the course of a project with changing requirements, seeing how much you can do in a limited amount of code does help to demonstrate the expressive power of a language. I'd like to see short, complete programs that truly exercise the unique new features of Go; not just snippets or \"Hello, World\".\nSo, post some cool code you've written with Go. Take advantage of its unique features, like its goroutines and channels for concurrency, or its interface based type system. Can you write a primitive chat server, or cool IRC bot? Implement a parallel Mandelbrot set that scales to many cores? Write an interpreter for some tiny language? And can you do it all in 30 lines? \nI chose 30 arbitrarily as about as much as you can fit into a Stack Overflow code block without it overflowing and getting a scroll bar; it should be enough to do something interesting without golfing too much, but short enough to keep everyone's attention for a quick demo.

I'm not sure that Python's Queue can do this.", "output": "There are many different implementations of producer-consumer queues, like queue.Queue available. They normally differ in a lot of properties like listed on this excellent article by Dmitry Vyukov. As you can see, there are more than 10k different combinations possible. The algorithms used for such queues also differ widely depending on the requirements. It's not possible to just extend an existing queue algorithm to guarantee additional properties, since that normally requires different internal data structures and different algorithms.\nGo's channels offer a relatively high number of guaranteed properties, so those channels might be suitable for a lot of programs. One of the hardest requirements there is the support for reading / blocking on multiple channels at once (select statement) and to choose a channel fairly if more than one branch in a select statement is able to proceed, so that no messages will be left behind. Python's queue.Queue doesn't offer this features, so it's simply not possible to archive the same behavior with it. \nSo, if you want to continue using queue.Queue you need to find workarounds for that problem. The workarounds have however their own list of drawbacks and are harder to maintain. Looking for another producer-consumer queue which offers the features you need might be a better idea! Anyway, here are two possible workarounds:\nPolling\nwhile True:\n  try:\n    i1 = c1.get_nowait()\n    print \"received %s from c1\" % i1\n  except queue.Empty:\n    pass\n  try:\n    i2 = c2.get_nowait()\n    print \"received %s from c2\" % i2\n  except queue.Empty:\n    pass\n  time.sleep(0.1)\n\nThis might use a lot of CPU cycles while polling the channels and might be slow when there are a lot of messages. Using time.sleep() with an exponential back-off time (instead of the constant 0.1 secs shown here) might improve this version drastically.\nA single notify-queue\nqueue_id = notify.get()\nif queue_id == 1:\n  i1 = c1.get()\n  print \"received %s from c1\" % i1\nelif queue_id == 2:\n  i2 = c2.get()\n  print \"received %s from c2\" % i2\n\nWith this setup, you must send something to the notify queue after sending to c1 or c2. This might work for you, as long as only one such notify-queue is enough for you (i.e. you do not have multiple \"selects\", each blocking on a different subset of your channels).\nAlternatively you can also consider using Go. Go's goroutines and concurrency support is much more powerful than Python's limited threading capabilities anyway."}

This allows you to run a cleanup function when the object falls out of scope. It is not guaranteed to run. However, when freeing memory, that does not really matter. What does matter is that for a long running process, it is likely to keep the garbage in check.\nHere are some excerpts from the docs (entire paragraphs were removed):\n\nSetFinalizer sets the finalizer associated with x to f. When the garbage collector finds an unreachable block with an associated finalizer, it clears the association and runs f(x) in a separate goroutine. This makes x reachable again, but now without an associated finalizer. Assuming that SetFinalizer is not called again, the next time the garbage collector sees that x is unreachable, it will free x.\nThe finalizer for x is scheduled to run at some arbitrary time after x becomes unreachable. There is no guarantee that finalizers will run before a program exits, so typically they are useful only for releasing non-memory resources associated with an object during a long-running program. For example, an os.File object could use a finalizer to close the associated operating system file descriptor when a program discards an os.File without calling Close, but it would be a mistake to depend on a finalizer to flush an in-memory I/O buffer such as a bufio.Writer, because the buffer would not be flushed at program exit.\nA single goroutine runs all finalizers for a program, sequentially.

Snit is still vastly different from Go's approach, but in that one respect they have some common philosophical ground.  It's a mechanism for joining together pieces of functionality and responsibility, not a hierarchy for the classes.\nAs others have stated, it's really about what kind of programming practices the language designers want to support.  All such choices come with their own pros and cons; I don't think \"best practices\" is a phrase that necessarily applies here.

That way, you can also use (= check out) specific versions of a library for that project, while using other versions for your other projects in other project folders (= GOPATHs).\nAs for your path issue: Go follows a generic paradigm of author/project (or organization/project). This will prevent naming clashes when several people, authors and organizations, start projects with the same names. (The author may then use sub-folders, sub-projects in “his” folder as well ofc.)\nIf you are aware of this and still want to use only myproj as your package path, there is no problem in creating the git repository in that folder - in contrary to the example package you linked to.\n\nComing back to my project, I need to package this up in a Git repository then I need a container directory.\n\nWhat makes you think so then?

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I would like to read from the original stdin of a Go program. For example, if I did echo test stdin | go run test.go, I would want to have access to \"test stdin\". I've tried reading from os.Stdin, but if there's nothing in it, then it will wait for input. I also tried checking the size first, but the os.Stdin.Stat().Size() is 0 even when input is passed in.\nWhat can I do?", "output": "I think your question per se has no sensible answer because there's just no such thing as \"initial stdin\".  Unix-like OSs, and Windows implement the concept of \"standard streams\", which works like this (simplified): when a process is created, it automagically has three file descriptors (handles in Windows) open — stdin, stdout and stderr.  No doubts, you're familiar with this concept, but I'd like to stress the meaning of the word \"stream\" there — in your example, when you call\n$ echo 'test stdin' | ./stdin\n\nthe shell creates a pipe, spawns two processes (one for echo and one for your binary) and makes use of the pipe it created: the pipe's write FD is attached to the echo's stdout and the pipe's read FD is attached to your binary's stdin.  Then whatever the echo process pleases to write to its stdout is piped (sic!) to the stdin of your process.\n(In reality most today's shells implement echo as a built-in primitive but this does not in any way change the semantics; your could as well have tried /bin/echo instead, which is a real program.  Also note that I just used ./stdin to refer to your program — this is for clarity, as go run stdin.go would do exactly this, in the end.)\nNote several crucial things here:\n\nThe writing process (echo in your case) is not oblidged to write anything to its stdout (for instance, echo -n would not write anything to its stdout and exit successfully).\nIt's also able to make arbitrary delays writing its data (either because it wants to make such delays or because it has been preempted by the OS or sleeps in some syscall waiting on some busy system resource etc).\nThe OS buffers transfers over pipes, and often the code in the program does this, too—though it may not be apparent for an inexperienced programmer. This means what the writing process sends to a pipe, might come out in arbitrary chunks on the reading side.1\nThere are only two ways to know the writing side has no more data to send over the pipe:\n\nSomehow encode this in the data itself (this means using an agreed upon data transfer protocol between the writer and the reader).\nThe writer might close its side of the pipe which would result in the \"end of file\" condition on the reader side (but only after the buffer is drained and one another call to read is attempted, which fails).\n\n\n\nLet's wrap this up: the behaviour you're observing is correct and normal.  If you expect to get any data from stdin, you must not expect it to be readily available.  If you also don't want to block on stdin, then create a goroutine which would do blocking reads from stdin in an endless loop (but checking for the EOF condition) and pass collected data up over a channel (possibly after certain processing, if needed).\n1 This is why certain tools which usually occur between two pipes in a pipeline, such as grep, might have special options to make them flush their stdout after writing each line — read about the --line-buffered option in the grep manual page for one example.  People who are not aware of this \"full buffering by default\" semantics are puzzled why tail -f /path/to/some/file.log | grep whatever | sed ... seems to stall and not display anything when it's obvious the monitored file gets updated.\n\nAs a side note: if you were to run your binary \"as is\", like in\n$ ./stdin\n\nthat would not meant the spawned process would not have stdin (or \"initial stdin\" or whaveter), instead, its stdin would be connected to the same stream your shell receives your keyboard input from (so you could directly type something to your process's stdin).\nThe only sure way to have a process's stdin connected to nowhere is to use\n$ ./stdin </dev/null\n\non Unix-like OSes and\nC:\\> stdin <NUL\n\non Windows.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm working on creating a version of Pastry natively in Go. From the design [PDF]:\n\nIt is assumed that the application\n  provides a function that allows each Pastry node to determine the “distance” of a node\n  with a given IP address to itself. A node with a lower distance value is assumed to be\n  more desirable. An application is expected to implements this function depending on its\n  choice of a proximity metric, using network services like traceroute or Internet subnet\n  maps, and appropriate caching and approximation techniques to minimize overhead.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what the best way to determine the \"proximity\" (i.e., network latency) between two EC2 instances programmatically from Go. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with low-level networking to be able to differentiate between the different types of requests I could use. Googling did not turn up any suggestions for measuring latency from Go, and general latency techniques always seem to be Linux binaries, which I'm hoping to avoid in the name of fewer dependencies. Any help?\nAlso, I note that the latency should be on the scale of 1ms between two EC2 instances. While I plan to use the implementation on EC2, it could hypothetically be used anywhere. Is latency generally so bad that I should expend the effort to ensure the network proximity of two nodes? Keep in mind that most Pastry requests can be served in log base 16 of the number of servers in the cluster (so for 10,000 servers, it would take approximately 3 requests, on average, to find the key being searched for). Is the latency from, for example, EC2's Asia-Pacific region to EC2's US-East region enough to justify the increased complexity and the overhead introduced by the latency checks when adding nodes?", "output": "A common distance metric in networking is to count the number of hops (node-hops in-between) a packet needs to reach its destination. This metric was also mentioned in the text you quoted. This could give you adequate distance values even for the low-latency environment you mentioned (EC2 “local”).\nFor the go logic itself, one would think the net package is what you are looking for. And indeed, for latency tests (ICMP ping) you could use it to create an IP connection\nconn, err := net.Dial(\"ip4\", \"127.0.0.1\")\n\ncreate your ICMP package structure and data, and send it. (See Wikipedia page on ICMP; IPv6 needs a different format.) Unfortunately you can’t create an ICMP connection directly, like you can with TCP and UDP, thus you will have to handle the package structure yourself.\nAs conn of type Conn is a Writer, you can then pass it your data, the ICMP data you defined.\nIn the ICMP Type field you can specify the message type. Values 8, 1 and 30 are the ones you are looking for. 8 for your echo request, the reply will be of type 1. And maybe 30 gives you some more information.\nUnfortunately, for counting the network hops, you will need the IP packet header fields. This means, you will have to construct your own IP packets, which net does not seem to allow.\nChecking the source of Dial(), it uses internetSocket, which is not exported/public. I’m not really sure if I’m missing something, but it seems there is no simple way to construct your own IP packets to send, with customizable header values. You’d have to further check how DialIP sends packages with internetSocket and duplicate and adapt that code/concept. Alternatively, you could use cgo and a system library to construct your own packages (this would add yet more complexity though).\nIf you are planning on using IPv6, you will (also) have to look into ICMPv6. Both packages have a different structure over their v4 versions.\n\nSo, I’d suggest using simple latency (timed ping) as a simple(r) implementation and then add node-hops at a later time/afterwards, if you need it. If you have both in place, maybe you also want to combine those 2 (less hops does not automatically mean better; think long overseas-cables etc)."}

You could alternatively write in a style of assembly that is directly compatible with Go, like in asm_linux_amd64.s, that requires that function names start with \"·\".\nOr, you can use nasm and gccgo, my favorite way so far. (Note that Nasm does not seem to support functions starting with \"·\").\nHere's a working \"hello world\" example:\nhello.asm:\n; Based on hello.asm from nasm\n\n    SECTION .data       ; data section\nmsg:    db \"Hello World\",10 ; the string to print, 10=cr\nlen:    equ $-msg       ; \"$\" means \"here\"\n                ; len is a value, not an address\n\n    SECTION .text       ; code section\n\nglobal go.main.hello        ; make label available to linker (Go)\ngo.main.hello:\n\n    ; --- setup stack frame\n    push rbp            ; save old base pointer\n    mov rbp,rsp   ; use stack pointer as new base pointer\n\n    ; --- print message\n    mov edx,len     ; arg3, length of string to print\n    mov ecx,msg     ; arg2, pointer to string\n    mov ebx,1       ; arg1, where to write, screen\n    mov eax,4       ; write sysout command to int 80 hex\n    int 0x80        ; interrupt 80 hex, call kernel\n\n    ; --- takedown stack frame\n    mov rsp,rbp  ; use base pointer as new stack pointer\n    pop rbp      ; get the old base pointer\n\n    ; --- return\n    mov rax,0       ; error code 0, normal, no error\n    ret         ; return\n\nmain.go:\npackage main\n\nfunc hello();\n\nfunc main() {\n    hello()\n    hello()\n}\n\nAnd a handy Makefile:\nmain: main.go hello.o\n    gccgo hello.o main.go -o main\n\nhello.o: hello.asm\n    nasm -f elf64 -o hello.o hello.asm\n\nclean:\n    rm -rf _obj *.o *~ *.6 *.gch a.out main\n\nI call hello() twice in main.go, just to double check that hello() returns properly.\nNote that calling interrupt 80h directly is not considered good style on Linux, and calling functions written is C is more \"future proof\". Also note that this is assembly specifically for 64-bit Linux, and is not platform-independent in any way, shape or form.\nI know it's not a direct answer to your question, but it's the easiest route I know for using assembly with Go, in lack of inlining.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm trying to port an algorithm from Python to Go. The central part of it is a tree built using dicts, which should stay this way since each node can have an arbitrary number of children. All leaves are at the same level, so up the the lowest level the dicts contain other dicts, while the lowest level ones contain floats. Like this:\ntree = {}\ninsert(tree, ['a', 'b'], 1.0)\nprint tree['a']['b']\n\nSo while trying to port the code to Go while learning the language at the same time, this is what I started with to test the basic idea:\nfunc main() {\n    tree := make(map[string]interface{})\n    tree[\"a\"] = make(map[string]float32)\n    tree[\"a\"].(map[string]float32)[\"b\"] = 1.0\n    fmt.Println(tree[\"a\"].(map[string]float32)[\"b\"])\n}\n\nThis works as expected, so the next step was to turn this into a routine that would take a \"tree\", a path, and a value. I chose the recursive approach and came up with this:\nfunc insert(tree map[string]interface{}, path []string, value float32) {\n    node := path[0]\n    l := len(path)\n    switch {\n    case l > 1:\n        if _, ok := tree[node]; !ok {\n            if l > 2 {\n                tree[node] = make(map[string]interface{})\n            } else {\n                tree[node] = make(map[string]float32)\n            }\n        }\n        insert(tree[node], path[1:], value) //recursion\n    case l == 1:\n        leaf := tree\n        leaf[node] = value\n    }\n}\n\nThis is how I imagine the routine should be structured, but I can't get the line marked with \"recursion\" to work. There is either a compiler error, or a runtime error if I try to perform a type assertion on tree[node]. What would be the correct way to do this?", "output": "Go is perhaps not the ideal solution for generic data structures like this. The type assertions make it possible, but manipulating data in it requires more work that you are used to from python and other scripting languages.\nAbout your specific issue: You are missing a type assertion in the insert() call. The value  of tree[node] is of type interface{} at that point. The function expects type map[string]interface{}. A type assertion will solve that.\nHere's a working example:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype Tree map[string]interface{}\n\nfunc main() {\n    t := make(Tree)\n    insert(t, []string{\"a\", \"b\"}, 1.0)\n\n    v := t[\"a\"].(Tree)[\"b\"]\n    fmt.Printf(\"%T %v\\n\", v, v)\n\n    // This prints: float32 1\n}\n\nfunc insert(tree Tree, path []string, value float32) {\n    node := path[0]\n    len := len(path)\n\n    switch {\n    case len == 1:\n        tree[node] = value\n\n    case len > 1:\n        if _, ok := tree[node]; !ok {\n            tree[node] = make(Tree)\n        }\n\n        insert(tree[node].(Tree), path[1:], value) //recursion\n    }\n}\n\nNote that I created a new type for the map. This makes the code a little easier to follow. I also use the same 'map[string]interface{}` for both tree nodes and leaves. If you want to get a float out of the resulting tree, another type assertion is needed:\nleaf := t[\"a\"].(Tree)[\"b\"]  // leaf is of type 'interface{}`.\nval := leaf.(float32)"}

And which also means you must compile the program to let it integrate plugins.\nFortunately, you can define a program accepting plugins in Go as in most languages, and Go, with interfaces and fast compilation doesn't make that task hard.\nHere are two possible approaches :\nSolution 1 : Plugin integrated in the main program\nSimilarly to Eclipse plugins, we can integrate the \"plugins\" in the main program memory, by simply recompiling the program. In this sense we can for example say that database drivers are plugins.\nThis may not feel as simple as in Java, as you must have a recompilation and you must in some point of your code import the \"plugin\" (see how it's done for database drivers) but, given the standardization of Go regarding directories and imports, it seems easy to handle that with a simple makefile importing the plugin and recompiling the application.\nGiven the ease and speed of compilation in Go, and the standardization of package structure, this seems to me to be a very viable solution.\nSolution 2 : Separate process\nIt's especially easy in Go to communicate and to handle asynchronous calls. Which means you could define a solution based on many process communicating by named pipes (or any networking solution). Note that there is a rpc package in Go. This would probably be efficient enough for most programs and the main program would be able to start and stop the plugin processes. This could very well feel similar to what you have in Eclipse with the added benefits of memory space protection.\nA last note from somebody who wrote several Eclipse plugins : you don't want that mess; keep it simple."}

Go is much more C++ like and \"low level\" oriented than C#, and C# has only a few functional features while Scala allows you to write typical \"functional\" Code (more verbose than OCaml or Haskell, but similar). Scala's type system is quite sophisticated, but is nevertheless based on a Java/C#-like foundation. On the other hand, Go's object-oriented part looks quite different. I didn't try out Go, as I found it too C-like and too low-level. As a Java programmer I know that C# is technically ahead and has a lot of nice features missing in Java. When learning Scala it widened my view, giving me the advantage and power of functional Code without losing the good things from the object oriented world. After the years in Java jail programming in Scala is a really refreshing and mindblowing experience."}

So, for example, you might have a string \"MyStruct\" and you want to create an object of this type.\nUnfortunately, that's not easily possible because Go is a statically typed language and the linker will eliminate dead code (or inline parts of it). So, there is no guarantee, that your final executable will even contain the code of \"MyStruct\".\nYou can however, maintain a global map[string]reflect.Type manually. For example by initializing this map in the init() function of your packages which defines such discover-able types. This will also tell the compiler that you are using the types. Afterwards, you can use this map to look up the reflect.Type of the type you want to create and use reflect.New to get a pointer to a new object of that type (stored as a reflect.Value). You can extract the object into an interface with something like this:\nreflect.New(yourtype).Elem().Interface()\n\nElem() will de-reference the pointer and Interface() will return the reflected value as an interface{}. See The Laws of Reflection for further details.\nPS: There might be a better way to structure your program which doesn't even require reflection and which let the compiler catch more errors. Have you considered using a factory method for example? An other easy solution might be to maintain a map[string]func() interface{} of functions which can be invoked to create a new object with that name."}

However this also means that the following code is legal\na := make(bag.Bag,0,0)\na.Add(1)\na.Add(\"Hello world!\")\na.Add(5.6)\na.Add(time.Now())\n\nI was just wondering if there was any way of enforcing the type so it conforms to a contract similar to\nBag<T> bagOfMyType = new Bag<T>()\n\ne.g.\nBag<Integer> bagOfInts = new Bag<Integer>()\n\nI know Go doesn't have generics and they're not really The Go Way, but I was just wondering if it is a possible to \"enforce\" anything at compile time (probably not) \nSorry for the long post\nEDIT: OK so I've been looking into this a little further, I've pretty much given up with the generics side of things (I understand this is not on the roadmap for Go) so I'm thinking of doing something similar to Haskell typeclasses with interfaces, e.g.\ntype T interface{}\ntype Bag interface {\n    Add(t T)\n    IsEmpty() bool\n    Size() int\n}\n\ntype IntSlice []int\n\nfunc (i *IntSlice) Add(t T) {\n    *i = append(*i, t.(int)) // will throw runtime exception if user attempts to add anything other than int\n}\n\nfunc (i *IntSlice) IsEmpty() bool {\n    return len(*i) == 0\n}\n\nfunc (i *IntSlice) Size() int {\n    return len(*i)\n}\n\nThe problem with this is the type enforcement is only enforced at runtime.\nAnyone got any ideas how to improve on this?", "output": "I'm new to Go myself, so I'm curious if someone will have a better answer, but here's how I see it:\nYou want compile-time enforcement that when Add() is called on an IntSlice, its parameter is an int.  Well, here's how you do that:\nfunc (i *IntSlice) Add(t int) {\n    *i = append(*i, t)\n}\n\nSince there aren't generics, the Add() method is going to be different for every type of Bag, so the Bag interface, assuming you need it, becomes just:\ntype Bag interface {\n    IsEmpty() bool\n    Size() int\n}\n\nThat makes sense to me, because you can't pass a Bag around and throw just anything in it.  Knowing that something is a Bag isn't enough to know how to call Add() on it; you must know what type of Bag you're dealing with.\nYou could make the interface specific to the type, like IntBag, but since only one type is actually going to satisfy that interface, you might as well get rid of the interface and change the name of IntSlice to IntBag.\nBasically that means giving up entirely on anything generic-like, and just creating a type with some methods that do what you want:\ntype IntBag []int\n\nfunc (b *IntBag) Add(i int) {\n    *b = append(*b, i)\n}\n\nfunc (b IntBag) IsEmpty() bool {\n    return len(b) == 0\n}\n\nfunc (b IntBag) Size() int {\n    return len(b)\n}\n\nUpdate: Sometimes generics really would come in handy.  It seems to me we're left choosing on a case-by-case basis what exactly is best for a given problem.  With empty interfaces and reflection, you can get some generic-like behavior, but it tends to be ugly and you give up some compile-time type checking.  Or you give up on generics and have some code-duplication. Or you just do it a totally different way.\nI asked a question a few weeks ago about how I should use Go to handle problems that look to me like they need class hierarchies. The answer was basically that there is no general solution; it's all case-by-case. I think the same applies for generics: there are no generics in Go, and there's no general solution for translating generics-based solutions to Go.\nThere are many cases where you might use generics in another language but interfaces are perfectly adequate (or truly shine) in Go.  Your example here is one where interfaces aren't really a proper replacement.  See also: Go Vs. Generics."}

However, I have encountered the following setback:\nI am taking advantage of the flexibility that the datastore provides by having several different structs with different properties being saved with the same entity name (\"Item\"). The Go language datastore reference states that \"the actual types passed do not have to match between Get and Put calls or even across different App Engine requests\", since entities are actually just a series of properties, and can therefore be stored in an appropriate container type that can support them.\nI need to query all of the entities stored under the entity name \"Item\" and encode them as JSON all at once. Using that entity property flexibility to my advantage, it is possible to store queried entities into an arbitrary datastore.PropertyList, however, the Get and GetAll functions return ErrFieldMismatch as an error when a property of the queried entities cannot be properly represented (that is to say, incompatible types, or simply a missing value).

Together these two runes are one character.\nThe definition of a character may vary depending on the application.\nFor normalization we will define it as:\n\na sequence of runes that starts with a starter,\na rune that does not modify or combine backwards with any other rune,\nfollowed by possibly empty sequence of non-starters, that is, runes that do (typically accents).\n\nThe normalization algorithm processes one character at at time.\n\nUsing that package and its Iter type, the actual number of \"character\" would be:\npackage main\n    \nimport \"fmt\"\nimport \"golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm\"\n    \nfunc main() {\n    var ia norm.Iter\n    ia.InitString(norm.NFKD, \"école\")\n    nc := 0\n    for !ia.Done() {\n        nc = nc + 1\n        ia.Next()\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Number of chars: %d\\n\", nc)\n}\n\nHere, this uses the Unicode Normalization form NFKD \"Compatibility Decomposition\"\n\nOliver's answer points to UNICODE TEXT SEGMENTATION as the only way to reliably determining default boundaries between certain significant text elements: user-perceived characters, words, and sentences.\nFor that, you need an external library like rivo/uniseg, which does Unicode Text Segmentation.\nThat  will actually count  \"grapheme cluster\", where multiple code points may be combined into one user-perceived character.\npackage uniseg\n    \nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \n    \"github.com/rivo/uniseg\"\n)\n    \nfunc main() {\n    gr := uniseg.NewGraphemes(\"!\")\n    for gr.Next() {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%x \", gr.Runes())\n    }\n    // Output: [1f44d 1f3fc] [21]\n}\n\nTwo graphemes, even though there are three runes (Unicode code points).\nYou can see other examples in \"How to manipulate strings in GO to reverse them?\"\n‍ alone is one grapheme, but, from unicode to code points converter, 4 runes:\n\n: women (1f469)\ndark skin (1f3fe)\nZERO WIDTH JOINER (200d)\nred hair (1f9b0)"}

If so, the cost of opening a new connection won't be too high, and might even be insignificant from a performance perspective regardless.\nMy two cents: Do one TCP connection per request and just profile it and see what happens. It is very easy to add pooling later if you're DoSing yourself, but it may never be a problem. That'll work right now, and you won't have to mess around with a third party library that may cause more problems than it solves.\nAlso, TCP programming is really easy.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I wanted to create a function of a certain type. I've found one way to do it, but there must be other, cleaner and nicer ways that do not include using var.

The spec says this about function types:\n\nA function type denotes the set of all functions with the same parameter and result types.\n\nAnd this about type identity:\n\nTwo function types are identical if they have the same number of parameters and result values, corresponding parameter and result types are identical, and either both functions are variadic or neither is. Parameter and result names are not required to match.\n\nThis means that each function has its own function type. If two functions have the same signature (parameter and result types), they share one function type. By writing type Greeting func... you're just giving a name to a particular function type, not defining a new one.\nSo the following code works, and I hope shows the right way to work with function types in Go:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype Greeting func(name string) string\n\nfunc say(g Greeting, n string) { fmt.Println(g(n)) }\n\nfunc french(name string) string { return \"Bonjour, \" + name }\n\nfunc main() {\n        english := func(name string) string { return \"Hello, \" + name }\n\n        say(english, \"ANisus\")\n        say(french, \"ANisus\")\n}\n\nNotice that I also dropped semicolon and parenthesis from your english function. Go developers don't use these punctuations if they don't have to.\nUPDATE: Now that you've provided a sample code I can clearly understand the problem.\nFor this purpose your code is good enough and there are not much other ways of doing it. If you like you can cast just before calling the method:\nenglish := func(name string) string { return \"Hello, \" + name }\nGreeting(english).exclamation(\"ANisus\")\n\nBut I'm not sure this is an improvement. I'm just saying that for what you want to do there does not seem to be other ways to write the code.\nThat is, if we don't want to change your types. I mean, the whole idea of calling a method on a function type seems a little weird. Not that it's wrong, but a little rare. Another way of achieving the same effect in a more usual way is through a struct type and having a field for the function. Something like this:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype Greeting struct {\n    say func(name string) string\n}\n\nfunc newGreeting(f func(string) string) *Greeting {\n    return &Greeting{say: f}\n}\n\nfunc (g *Greeting) exclamation(name string) string { return g.say(name) + \"!\" }\n\nfunc main() {\n    english := &Greeting{say: func(name string) string {\n        return \"Hello, \" + name\n    }}\n\n    french := newGreeting(func(name string) string {\n        return \"Bonjour, \" + name\n    })\n\n    fmt.Println(english.exclamation(\"ANisus\"))\n    fmt.Println(french.exclamation(\"ANisus\"))\n}\n\nHere english and french show two different ways of coding the same thing. Again, I'm not saying that this is the better solution, but a more usual and more flexible way of achieving the same effect."}

Otherwise you can add an empty __init__.py into a subfolder and access the modules via\nfrom subfolder import foo\n\nYou can then access functions by simply referencing them through the module name, e.g. y = foo.bar(y). This makes it easy to separate logical pieces of code from one another.\n\nIn Go however, you specify the package name in the source file itself, e.g.\npackage foo\n\nat the top of the 'foo' module, which you can then supposedly import through\nimport (\n        \"foo\"\n              )\n\nand then refer to it through that, i.e. y := foo.Bar(x) . But what I can't wrap my head around is how this works in practice.

A bunch of files in the same directory that all start with the same package <name> directive means that they are treated as one big set of code by Go.  You can transparently call functions in a.go from b.go.  This is mostly for the benefit of code organization.  \nA fictional example would be a \"blog\" package might be laid out with blog.go (the main file), entry.go, and server.go.  It's up to you.  While you could write a blog package in one big file, that tends to affect readability.\n\nMultiple packages\n\nThe standard library is done this way.  Basically you create modules and optionally install them into $GOROOT.  Any program you write can import \"<name>\" and then call <name>.someFunction()\nIn practice any standalone or shared components should be compiled into packages.  Back to the blog package above, If you wanted to add a news feed, you could refactor server.go into a package.

Sometimes the code just expresses it intent better in one style or the other.\nGo does not have built-in support for constructors, so usually you would wrap the call to new into a function, for example NewMyStruct() which does all the necessary initialization. It also makes it possible to initialize private fields or hide the struct behind an interface, to prevent users of the object from directly messing with its internals. Also evolving the structure of the struct is easier that way, when you don't need to change all of its users when adding/removing/renaming/reordering fields."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "From the Go documentation on method declarations:\n\nThe receiver type must be of the form T or *T where T is a type name. T is called the receiver base type or just base type. The base type must not be a pointer or interface type and must be declared in the same package as the method.\n\nCan anyone give me some insight on why this might be? Are there any other (statically typed) languages that would allow this? I really want to define methods on an interface so I can treat any instance of a given interface type as another. For example (stealing the example from the Wikipedia article on the Template Method Pattern) if the following was valid:\ntype Game interface {\n    PlayOneGame(playersCount int)\n}\n\ntype GameImplementation interface {\n    InitializeGame()\n    MakePlay(player int)\n    EndOfGame() bool\n    PrintWinner()\n}\n\nfunc (game *GameImplementation) PlayOneGame(playersCount int) {\n    game.InitializeGame()\n    for j := 0; !game.EndOfGame(); j = (j + 1) % playersCount {\n        game.MakePlay(j)\n    }\n    game.PrintWinner()\n}\n\nI could use any instance implementing \"GameImplementation\" as a \"Game\" without any conversion:\nvar newGame Game\nnewGame = NewMonopolyGame() // implements GameImplementation\nnewGame.PlayOneGame(2)\n\nUPDATE: the purpose of this was to try and achieve all the benefits of abstract base classes without all the coupling that goes with an explicit hierarchy.

In Java you would probably use an abstract class if you need parts of the behavior to be pre-defined but I think the only way to do that in Go is to use functions rather than methods.\nI believe that for your example the more Go idiomatic code would be something like this:\ntype GameImplementation interface {\n    InitializeGame()\n    MakePlay(player int)\n    EndOfGame() bool\n    PrintWinner()\n}\n\nfunc PlayOneGame(game GameImplementation, playersCount int) {\n    game.InitializeGame()\n    for j := 0; !game.EndOfGame(); j = (j + 1) % playersCount {\n        game.MakePlay(j)\n    }\n    game.PrintWinner()\n}\n\nWhere PlayOneGame and any specific game implementation are probably living in different packages.\nHere is some discussion on golang-nuts"}

Also note that Go channels support multiple-writers (as well as mutliple readers) by default. So, it might be enough to use exactly one input channel per goroutine. For example, routine1 might only read commands from a channel called command1, but both routine2 and routine3 might use the same command1 channel to send messages to routine1.\nAnother common idiom in Go is to pass a reply channel as part of the message. For example:\ntype Command struct {\n    Cmd string\n    Reply chan-> int\n}\n\nfunc routine2() {\n    reply := make(chan int)\n    command1 <- Command{\"doSomething\", reply}\n    status := <-reply\n}\n\nfunc routine1() {\n    cmd <- command1;\n    // process cmd.Cmd\n    cmd.Reply <- 200 // SUCCESS (status code)\n}\n\nDepending on your actual problem, this might simplify your program drastically :)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "The golang package \"net/http\" uses the global variable DefaultServeMux to register handlers. Is this considered a good practice or even an golang idiom? Is it a global variable after all?\nThe two main reasons not to use global variables are AFAIK 1) that they add to complexity and 2) are problematic in concurrent programs.\nMaybe 1) is not considered important in this case because the developer can choose not to use DefaultServerMux? What about 2)? Are global variables always thread/goroutine safe in Go? Still, I'm surprised that it's used in Go's standard library. I've never seen such practice in other languages / standard libraries.", "output": "Is it a global variable after all?\n\nYes. The variable is defined on root level, which makes it global throughout the package.\nHowever, this is not a global variable which stores all the sensible information\nof the net/http package. It is merely a convenience setup which uses the content of\nthe net/http package to provide an quickstart opportunity to the user.\nThis also means, that is does not add much complexity.\n\nIs this considered a good practice or even an golang idiom?\n\nIMO, it is good practice to aid the user with the usage of a package.\nIf you're finding that you could save the user some time by providing a \ngood default configuration, do so.\nHowever, you should be careful when you're about to export variables. \nThey should be made ready for concurrent access. \nThe DefaultServeMux (or better, the underlying ServeMux), for example, is using a mutex to be thread safe.\n\nAre global variables always thread/goroutine safe in Go?\n\nNo. Without proper synchronization (mutex, channel, ...), everything that is accessed concurrently is problematic and will most certainly blow everything to bits and pieces.\n\nI've never seen such practice in other languages / standard libraries.\n\nPython's logging module, for example, provides a function to retrieve the root logging object, which one can call methods on to customize the logging behaviour. This could be seen as a global object, as it is mutable and defined in the module."}

Alternatively, is there a way to set the upper bound on the random numbers this generates?", "output": "crypto/rand provides only binary stream of random data, but you can read integers from it using encoding/binary:\npackage main\n\nimport \"encoding/binary\"\nimport \"crypto/rand\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    var n int32\n    binary.Read(rand.Reader, binary.LittleEndian, &n)\n    println(n)\n}"}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm currently working through the Tour of Go, and I thought that goroutines have been used similarly to Python generators, particularly with Question 66. I thought 66 looked complex, so I rewrote it to this:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc fibonacci(c chan int) {\n    x, y := 1, 1\n\n    for {\n        c <- x\n        x, y = y, x + y\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    c := make(chan int)\n    go fibonacci(c)\n\n    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n        fmt.Println(<-c)\n    }\n}\n\nThis seems to work. A couple of questions:\n\nIf I turn up the buffer size on the channel to say, 10, fibonacci would fill up 10 further spots, as quickly as possible, and main would eat up the spots as quickly as it could go. Is this right? This would be more performant than a buffer size of 1 at the expense of memory, correct?\nAs the channel doesn't get closed by the fibonacci sender, what happens memory-wise when we go out of scope here? My expectation is that once c and go fibonacci is out of scope, the channel and everything on it gets garbage-collected. My gut tells me this is probably not what happens.", "output": "I like @tux21b's answer; having the channel created in the fib() function makes the calling code nice and clean.  To elaborate a bit, you only need a separate 'quit' channel if there's no way to tell the function when to stop when you call it.  If you only ever care about \"numbers up to X\", you can do this:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc fib(n int) chan int {\n    c := make(chan int)\n\n    go func() {\n        x, y := 0, 1\n\n        for x < n {\n            c <- x\n            x, y = y, x+y\n        }\n\n        close(c)\n    }()\n\n    return c\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Print the Fibonacci numbers less than 500\n    for i := range fib(500) {\n        fmt.Println(i)\n    }\n}\n\nIf you want the ability to do either, this is a little sloppy, but I personally like it better than testing the condition in the caller and then signalling a quit through a separate channel:\nfunc fib(wanted func (int, int) bool) chan int {\n    c := make(chan int)\n\n    go func() {\n        x, y := 0, 1\n\n        for i := 0; wanted(i, x); i++{\n            c <- x\n            x, y = y, x+y\n        }\n\n        close(c)\n    }()\n\n    return c\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n    for n := range fib(func(i, x int) bool { return i < 10 }) {\n        fmt.Println(n)\n    }\n\n    // Print the Fibonacci numbers less than 500\n    for n := range fib(func(i, x int) bool { return x < 500 }) {\n        fmt.Println(n)\n    }\n}\n\nI think it just depends on the particulars of a given situation whether you:\n\nTell the generator when to stop when you create it by\n\nPassing an explicit number of values to generate\nPassing a goal value\nPassing a function that determines whether to keep going\n\nGive the generator a 'quit' channel, test the values yourself, and tell it to quit when appropriate.\n\nTo wrap up and actually answer your questions:\n\nIncreasing the channel size would help performance due to fewer context switches. In this trivial example, neither performance nor memory consumption are going to be an issue, but in other situations, buffering the channel is often a very good idea.  The memory used by make (chan int, 100) hardly seems significant in most cases, but it could easily make a big performance difference.\nYou have an infinite loop in your fibonacci function, so the goroutine running it will run (block on c <- x, in this case) forever.  The fact that (once c goes out of scope in the caller) you won't ever again read from the channel you share with it doesn't change that.  And as @tux21b pointed out, the channel will never be garbage collected since it's still in use. This has nothing to do with closing the channel (the purpose of which is to let the receiving end of the channel know that no more values will be coming) and everything to do with not returning from your function."}

In Go it's the package that is imported, and it doesn't matter how its contents are organised into different source files (it won't be visible to the importer anyhow).\nMy personal recommendation is to avoid creating unnecessary files. If the code is relatively short, keep it in one file. If it's long, then consider splitting off parts for which it feels natural to do so (e.g. interface + related functions that would be probably form a separate class if you were doing it in Java or C++). Don't split off anything just for the sake of separating definitions from code; it doesn't make sense in Go even though it does in C."}

What happens when you pass a struct and modify it in a function? In C, Go, and other pass by value languages, the struct given in the parameter is only a copy. Therefore, you can not modify the original. Only return the new struct.\nWhen you define func (f *Foo) AddToEntry(), you are defining the receiver, the first parameter, as a pointer. Obviously, given a pointer, you can modify the original struct. What is hidden is that you are implicitly referencing when you access a struct in Go. To put it another way, (*ptrFoo).Entry is the same as ptrFoo.Entry in Go.\nSo the issue here is that for those unaccustomed to go, the syntax is hiding some of what is going on. In C, you would never be able to edit a struct unless you passed a pointer to it. The same happens in Go. You need to use a pointer receiver in order to modify what you are receiving."}

Slices cannot be used as keys for maps in Go; arrays can, but the length of an array is a part of it's type and I'm interested in being able to use sequences of length determined at runtime. I could (1) use arrays of A declaring a maximum length for them or (2) use slices of A, serialize them to strings for use as keys (this technique is familiar to Awk and Lua programmers...). Is there a better work around for this \"feature\" of Go than the ones I've described?\nAs pointed out by Jeremy Wall in answer to my original version of the question, where I had A = int, option (2) is pretty good for integers, since you can use slices of runes for which conversion to string is just a cast.", "output": "Will a sequence of rune instead of integers work for you? runes are uint32 and the conversion to a string is just a cast:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype myKey struct {\n  seq []int\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    m := make(map[string]string)\n    key := []rune{1, 2}\n    m[string(key)] = \"foo\"\n    fmt.Print(\"lookup: \", m[string(key)])\n}\n\nYou can play with this code here: http://play.golang.org/p/Kct1dum8A0"}

Can I use OutputDebugString?", "output": "Update: There is now an official page in the docs on Debugging Go Code with GDB. Much has changed since this answer was written, and several of the limitations listed below have been removed. I'm leaving the rest of this answer for posterity, but if you want to debug Go code, follow the link above.\nThe Go linkers now emit DWARF debugging symbols that can be interpreted by gdb version 7.x.\nHighlight from the blog post linked above:\nYou can...\n\nload a Go program in GDB version 7.x\nlist all Go, C, and assembly source files by line (parts of the Go runtime are written in C and assembly),\nset breakpoints by line and step through the code,\nprint stack traces and inspect stack frames, and\nfind the addresses and print the contents of most variables.\n\nThere are still some inconveniences:\n\nThe emitted DWARF code is unreadable by the GDB version 6.x that ships with Mac OS X. We would gladly accept patches to make the DWARF output compatible with the standard OS X GDB, but until that’s fixed you’ll need to download, build, and install GDB 7.x to use it under OS X. The source can be found at http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/. Due to the particulars of OS X you’ll need to install the binary on a local file system with chgrp procmod and chmod g+s.\nNames are qualified with a package name and, as GDB doesn't understand Go packages, you must reference each item by its full name. For example, the variable named v in package main must be referred to as 'main.v', in single quotes. A consequence of this is that tab completion of variable and function names does not work.\nLexical scoping information is somewhat obfuscated. If there are multiple variables of the same name, the nth instance will have a suffix of the form ‘#n’. We plan to fix this, but it will require some changes to the data exchanged between the compiler and linker.\nSlice and string variables are represented as their underlying structure in the runtime library. They will look something like {data = 0x2aaaaab3e320, len = 1, cap = 1}. For slices, you must dereference the data pointer to inspect the elements.\n\nSome things don't work:\n\nChannel, function, interface, and map variables cannot be inspected.\nOnly Go variables are annotated with type information; the runtime's C variables are not.\nWindows and ARM binaries do not contain DWARF debugging information and, as such, cannot be inspected with GDB."}

Also, my previous revision would exit before processObjects could complete.  The way I chose to synchronize the goroutines is by creating a couple more channels that pass around dummy values to ensure that the cleanup gets finished properly.

Is there a good rule of thumb?", "output": "There are two things you want to keep in mind, performance and API.\nHow is a Car used? Is it an object which has state? Is it a large struct? Unfortunately, it is impossible to answer when I have no idea what a Car is. Truthfully, the best way is to see what others do and copy them. Eventually, you get a feeling for this sort of thing. I will now describe three examples from the standard library and explain why I think they used what they did.\n\nhash/crc32: The crc32.NewIEEE() function returns a pointer type (actually, an interface, but the underlying type is a pointer). An instance of a hash function has state. As you write information to a hash, it sums up the data so when you call the Sum() method, it will give you the state of that one instance.\ntime: The time.Date function returns a Time struct. Why? A time is a time. It has no state. It is like an integer where you can compare them, preform maths on them, etc. The API designer decided that a modification to a time would not change the current one but make a new one. As a user of the library, if I want the time one month from now, I would want a new time object, not to change the current one I have. A time is also only 3 words in length. In other words, it is small and there would be no performance gain in using a pointer.\nmath/big: big.NewInt() is an interesting one. We can pretty much agree that when you modify a big.Int, you will often want a new one. A big.Int has no internal state, so why is it a pointer? The answer is simply performance. The programmers realized that big ints are … big. Constantly allocating each time you do a mathematical operation may not be practical. So, they decided to use pointers and allow the programmer to decide when to allocate new space.\n\nHave I answered your question? Probably not. It is a design decision and you need to figure it out on a case by case basis. I use the standard library as a guide when I am designing my own libraries. It really all comes down to judgement and how you expect client code to use your types."}

When it does I write a bool on an other channel which is used in the main loop to break. The problem is, is that Recv is blocking, the loop never gets to check the loop condition. I circumvent the problem by passing the NOBLOCK constant to Recv. But I feel there is a better way as Recv should return a EINTR when interrupted (which it doesn't as far as I can tell).

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "The introduction documents dedicate many paragraphs to explaining the difference between new() and make(), but in practice, you can create objects within local scope and return them.\nWhy would you use the pair of allocators?", "output": "Go has multiple ways of memory allocation and value initialization:\n&T{...}, &someLocalVar, new, make\nAllocation can also happen when creating composite literals.\n\nnew can be used to allocate values such as integers, &int is illegal:\nnew(Point)\n&Point{}      // OK\n&Point{2, 3}  // Combines allocation and initialization\n\nnew(int)\n&int          // Illegal\n\n// Works, but it is less convenient to write than new(int)\nvar i int\n&i\n\nThe difference between new and make can be seen by looking at the following example:\np := new(chan int)   // p has type: *chan int\nc := make(chan int)  // c has type: chan int\n\nSuppose Go does not have new and make, but it has the built-in function NEW. Then the example code would look like this:\np := NEW(*chan int)  // * is mandatory\nc := NEW(chan int)\n\nThe * would be mandatory, so:\nnew(int)        -->  NEW(*int)\nnew(Point)      -->  NEW(*Point)\nnew(chan int)   -->  NEW(*chan int)\nmake([]int, 10) -->  NEW([]int, 10)\n\nmake(Point)  // Illegal\nmake(int)    // Illegal\n\nYes, merging new and make into a single built-in function is possible. However, it is probable that a single built-in function would lead to more confusion among new Go programmers than having two built-in functions.\nConsidering all of the above points, it appears more appropriate for new and make to remain separate."}

I wrote a very simple program that factorizes a big semiprime number by division trials. Since no communications are involved, I expected an almost perfect speedup. However, the program seems to scale very badly.\nI timed the program with 1, 2, 4, and 8 processes, running on a 8 (real, not HT) cores computer, using the system timecommand. The number I factorized is \"28808539627864609\". Here are my results:\n\ncores  time (sec) speedup\n  1   60.0153      1\n  2   47.358       1.27\n  4   34.459       1.75\n  8   28.686       2.10\n\nHow to explain such bad speedups? Is it a bug in my program, or is it a problem with go runtime? How could I get better performances? I'm not talking about the algorithm by itself (I know there are better algorithms to factorize semiprime numbers), but about the way I parallelized it.\nHere is the source code of my program:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"big\"\n    \"flag\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"runtime\"\n)\n\nfunc factorize(n *big.Int, start int, step int, c chan *big.Int) {\n\n    var m big.Int\n    i := big.NewInt(int64(start))\n    s := big.NewInt(int64(step))\n    z := big.NewInt(0)\n\n    for {\n        m.Mod(n, i)\n        if m.Cmp(z) == 0{\n            c <- i\n        }\n        i.Add(i, s)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    var np *int = flag.Int(\"n\", 1, \"Number of processes\")\n    flag.Parse()\n\n    runtime.GOMAXPROCS(*np)\n\n    var n big.Int\n    n.SetString(flag.Arg(0), 10) // Uses number given on command line\n    c := make(chan *big.Int)\n    for i:=0; i<*np; i++ {\n        go factorize(&n, 2+i, *np, c)\n    }\n    fmt.Println(<-c)\n}\n\n\nEDIT\nProblem really seems to be related to Mod function. Replacing it by Rem gives better but still imperfect performances and speedups. Replacing it by QuoRem gives 3 times faster performances, and perfect speedup. Conclusion: it seems memory allocation kills parallel performances in Go. Why? Do you have any references about this?", "output": "Big.Int methods generally have to allocate memory, usually to hold the result of the computation.  The problem is that there is just one heap and all memory operations are serialized.  In this program, the numbers are fairly small and the (parallelizable) computation time needed for things like Mod and Add is small compared to the non-parallelizable operations of repeatedly allocating all the tiny little bits of memory.\nAs far as speeding it up, there is the obvious answer of don't use big.Ints if you don't have to.  Your example number happens to fit in 64 bits.  If you plan on working with really big big numbers though, the problem will kind of go away on its own.  You will spend much more time doing computations, and the time spent in the heap will be relatively much less.\nThere is a bug in your program, by the way, although it's not related to performance.  When you find a factor and return the result on the channel, you send a pointer to the local variable i.  This is fine, except that you don't break out of the loop then.  The loop in the goroutine continues incrementing i and by the time the main goroutine gets around to fishing the pointer out of the channel and following it, the value is almost certain to be wrong."}

I don't have much knowledge on Python, can anyone tell me why Go is better/worse than Cython?", "output": "Cython isn't really a language in the conventional sense. It is a preprocessor for building Python extensions that takes Python-like syntax (actually they strive for full Python compatibility) and produces C code (using the Python C API). Doing this they are able to include some special case optimisations, but the real benefits come when you add Cython specific static type information which is incorporated into the C code, bypassing the Python runtime for those operations and resulting in a high speed up. \nGo is a compiled programming language. The first thing that can be done in Go is producing an executable that doesn't include the Python runtime/start a Python interpreter - this is impossible in Cython. (May not be technically impossible - but there is really no point to use Cython if you are not working with Python). Since Cython just produces C most of your questions in the comment don't really apply - you can use any C debugger (although the fact that's a Python extension makes things a bit more complicated)."}

Better options are to run it in the background by adding a \"&\" to the end of the command line (okay), start it from init (better), or use a process monitor like supervise (best).\nDoes the application act like apache?\nEssentially, yes. It listens for HTTP requests and responds to them.\nDoes apache need to be run next to this app?\nNo, the Go application can handle the requests by itself. Some people run apache or some other server on the front end (listening to port 80) and forward requests to their application (listening on port 8080 or some other port) using mod_proxy.\nOne advantage to doing that are that you can run several different application servers in their own process. For example, you could use Ruby on Rails for the main site, and handle API requests with a Go program.\nAnother advantage is that your program doesn't need to be started as root to listen to port 80. You can just run as a normal user without worrying about dropping privileges after you open the connection.\nIs there a premade Go server app that has the verboseness of apache?\nAs far as I know, there are no go servers that would compare to Apache. Go is new enough that it will probably be awhile for something like that.\nThere are some frameworks that makes it easier to write web applications using the built-in HTTP server though.

Go also has a go keyword, that according to the language spec initiates the execution of a function concurrently as an independent thread and continues to execute the code without waiting. \nThe exact pattern I'm interested in is something like this (Go's syntax is weird - variables are declared by varName varType instead of the usual inverted way - but I think it is readable):\nfunc generateStep(ch chan int) {\n      //ch is a variable of type chan int, which is a channel that comunicate integers\n      for {\n          ch <- randomInteger() //just sends random integers in the channel \n      }\n\nfunc filter(input, output chan int) {\n      state int\n      for {\n          step <- input  //reads an int from the input channel\n          newstate := update(state, step) //update the variable with some update function\n          if criteria(newstate, state) {\n             state = newstate // if the newstate pass some criteria, accept the update\n          } \n          output <- state    //pass it to the output channel\n      } \n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    intChan := make(chan int) \n    mcChan  := make(chan int) \n    go generateStep(intChan)     // execute the channels concurrently\n    go filter(intChan, mcChan)\n    for i:=0; i<numSteps; i++  {\n        x <- mcChan        // get values from the filtered channel\n        accumulateStats(x)  // calculate some statistics\n    } \n    printStatisticsAbout(x)\n}\n\nMy primary interest is to do Monte Carlo simulations, in which I generate configurations sequentially by trying to modify the current state of the system and accepting the modification if it satisfies some criteria. \nThe fact the using those channel stuff I could write a very simple, readable and small Monte Carlo simulation that would run in parallel in my multicore processor really impressed me. \nThe problem is that Go have some limitations (specially, it lacks polymorphism in the way I'm accustomed to in Haskell), and besides that, I really like Haskell and don't wanna trade it away. So the question is if there's some way to use some mechanics that looks like the code above to do a concurrent simulation in Haskell easily. \nEDIT(2, context):\nI'm not learned in Computer Science, specially in concurrency. I'm just a guy who creates simple programs to solve simple problems in my daily research routine in a discipline not at all related to CS. I just find the way Haskell works interesting and like to use it to do my little chores. \nI never heard about alone pi-calculus or CSP channels. Sorry if the question seems ill posed, it's probably my huge-ignorance-about-the-matter's fault. \nYou are right, I should be more specific about what pattern in Go I'd like to replicate in Haskell, and I'll try to edit the question to be more specific. But don't expect profound theoretical questions. The thing is just that, from the few stuff I read and coded, it seems Go have a neat way to do concurrency (and in my case this just means that my job of making all my cores humming with numerical calculations is easier), and if I could use a similar syntax in Haskell I'd be glad.", "output": "I think what you are looking for is  Control.Concurrent.Chan from Base. I haven't found it to be any different from go's chans other then the obvious haskellifications. Channels aren't something that is special to go, have a look at the wiki page about it.\nChannels are part of a more general concept called communicating sequential processes (CSP), and if you want to do programming in the style of CSP in Haskell you might want to take a look at the Communicating Haskell Processes (CHP) package.\nCHP is only one way of doing concurrency in Haskell, take a look at the Haskellwiki concurrency page for more information. I think your use case might be best written using Data Parrallel Haskell, however that is currently a work in progress, so you might want to use something else for now."}

See GetMulti, where each key is converted from a string to a []byte via a simple cast.\nSo, the final answer to your question depends on you finding a path through both mkPbKey and GetMulti that results in the same key. It seems to me like if you give Java a key of type String, and it has length less than 250, and you remember to put \"\" before and after your keys in Go, it might work.

A root statement can have many proofs and disproofs, each of which may also have proofs and disproofs.  Statements can also be used in multiple graphs, and graphs can be analyzed under a \"given context\" or assumption.\nI need to construct a bayesian network of related arguments, so that each node propagates influence fairly and accurately to it's connected arguments; I need to be able to calculate the probability of chains of connected nodes concurrently, with each node requiring datastore lookups that must block to get results; the process is mostly I/O bound, and my datastore connection can run asynchronously in java, go and python {google appengine}.  Once each lookup completes, it propagates the effects to all other connected nodes until the probability delta drops below a threshold of irrelevance {currently 0.1%}.  Each node of the process must calculate chains of connections, then sum up all the results across all queries to adjust validity results, with results chained outward to any connected arguments.\nIn order to avoid recurring infinitely, I was thinking of using an A*-like process in goroutines to propagate updates to the argument maps, with a heuristic based on compounding influence which ignores nodes once probability of influence dips below, say 0.1% .  I'd tried to set up the calculations with SQL triggers, but it got complex and messy way too fast. Then I moved to google appengine to take advantage of asynchronous nosql, and it was better, but still too slow.  I need to be run the updates fast enough to get a snappy UI, so when a user creates or votes for or against a proof or disproof, they can see the results reflected in UI immediately.\nI think Go is the language of choice to support the concurrency I need, but I'm open to suggestions.  The client is a monolithic javascript app that just uses XHR and websockets to push and pull argument maps {and their updates} in real time.  I have a java prototype that can compute large chains in 10~15s, but monitoring of performance shows that most of my runtime is wasted in synchronization and overhead from ConcurrentHashMap.\nIf there are other highly-concurrent languages worth trying out, please let me know. I know java, python, go, ruby and scala, but will learn any language if it suits my needs. \nSimilarly, if there are open source implementations of huge Bayesian networks, please leave a suggestion.", "output": "I think it's a bit difficult to tell what you are asking about. Maybe you can elaborate on your question.\nGoroutines are quite cheap, and are a perfect match for modern web applications which use XHR or Websockets heavily (and other I/O bound applications which have to wait for database responses and stuff like that). Additionally, the go runtime is also able to execute those goroutines in parallel, so that Go is also a good fit for CPU bound tasks, which should take advantage of multiple cores and the speed of a natively compiled language.\nBut you should also keep in mind, that goroutines and channels aren't for free. They still require some amount of memory and each synchronization point (e.g. a channel send or receive) comes with its cost. That's normally not a problem, since the synchronization is, in comparison to a database query for example, extremely cheap, but it might not be suited for building efficient Bayesian networks, especially if the actual work of each goroutine / node is negligible in comparison to the synchronization overhead.\nYour primary goal for every concurrent program should be to avoid shared mutability as far as possible. So a Bayesian network modeled with goroutines and channels might be a good educational example and a great way to measure the performance of Go's channel implementation, but it's probably not the best fit for your problem."}

However, the GobEncoder and GobDecoder interfaces were recently added to gob; if you need to serialize a complex struct with unexported fields, encourage the author of the package to implement these interfaces. Even better, implement them yourself (shouldn't be hard for template.Template) and contribute your patch."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I was going through some code written in Google's Go language, and I came across this:\nfunc Statusln(a ...interface{})\nfunc Statusf(format string, a ...interface{})\n\nI don't understand what the ... means.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "In looking at Go and Erlang's approach to concurrency, I noticed that they both rely on message passing.\nThis approach obviously alleviates the need for complex locks because there is no shared state.\nHowever, consider the case of many clients wanting parallel read-only access to a single large data structure in memory -- like a suffix array.\nMy questions:\n\nWill using shared state be faster and use less memory than message passing, as locks will mostly be unnecessary because the data is read-only, and only needs to exist in a single location?\nHow would this problem be approached in a message passing context? Would there be a single process with access to the data structure and clients would simply need to sequentially request data from it? Or, if possible, would the data be chunked to create several processes that hold chunks?\nGiven the architecture of modern CPUs & memory, is there much difference between the two solutions -- i.e., can shared memory be read in parallel by multiple cores -- meaning there is no hardware bottleneck that would otherwise make both implementations roughly perform the same?", "output": "Yes, shared state could be faster in this case.  But only if you can forgo the locks, and this is only doable if it's absolutely read-only.  if it's 'mostly read-only' then you need a lock (unless you manage to write lock-free structures, be warned that they're even trickier than locks), and then you'd be hard-pressed to make it perform as fast as a good message-passing architecture.\nYes, you could write a 'server process' to share it. With really lightweight processes, it's no more heavy than writing a small API to access the data.  Think like an object (in OOP sense) that 'owns' the data.  Splitting the data in chunks to enhance parallelism (called 'sharding' in DB circles) helps in big cases (or if the data is on slow storage).\nEven if NUMA is getting mainstream, you still have more and more cores per NUMA cell.  And a big difference is that a message can be passed between just two cores, while a lock has to be flushed from cache on ALL cores, limiting it to the inter-cell bus latency (even slower than RAM access).  If anything, shared-state/locks is getting more and more unfeasible.\n\nin short.... get used to message passing and server processes, it's all the rage.\nEdit: revisiting this answer, I want to add about a phrase found on Go's documentation:\n\nshare memory by communicating, don't communicate by sharing memory.\n\nthe idea is: when you have a block of memory shared between threads, the typical way to avoid concurrent access is to use a lock to arbitrate.  The Go style is to pass a message with the reference, a thread only accesses the memory when receiving the message.  It relies on some measure of programmer discipline; but results in very clean-looking code that can be easily proofread, so it's relatively easy to debug.\nthe advantage is that you don't have to copy big blocks of data on every message, and don't have to effectively flush down caches as on some lock implementations.  It's still somewhat early to say if the style leads to higher performance designs or not.  (specially since current Go runtime is somewhat naive on thread scheduling)"}

The programmer needs to compute the termination condition for goroutines and also for the entire program. A program can be terminated in a normal way by calling os.Exit or by returning from the main() function.\nCreating a channel and delaying exit of main() by immediately receiving on said channel is a valid approach of preventing main from exiting. But it does not solve the problem  of detecting when to terminate the program.\nIf the number of goroutines cannot be computed before the main() function enters the wait-for-all-goroutines-to-terminate loop, you need to be sending deltas so that main function can keep track of how many goroutines are in flight:\n// Receives the change in the number of goroutines\nvar goroutineDelta = make(chan int)\n\nfunc main() {\n    go forever()\n\n    numGoroutines := 0\n    for diff := range goroutineDelta {\n        numGoroutines += diff\n        if numGoroutines == 0 { os.Exit(0) }\n    }\n}\n\n// Conceptual code\nfunc forever() {\n    for {\n        if needToCreateANewGoroutine {\n            // Make sure to do this before \"go f()\", not within f()\n            goroutineDelta <- +1\n\n            go f()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc f() {\n    // When the termination condition for this goroutine is detected, do:\n    goroutineDelta <- -1\n}\n\nAn alternative approach is to replace the channel with sync.WaitGroup. A drawback of this approach is that wg.Add(int) needs to be called before calling wg.Wait(), so it is necessary to create at least 1 goroutine in main() while subsequent goroutines can be created in any part of the program:\nvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Create at least 1 goroutine\n    wg.Add(1)\n    go f()\n\n    go forever()\n    wg.Wait()\n}\n\n// Conceptual code\nfunc forever() {\n    for {\n        if needToCreateANewGoroutine {\n            wg.Add(1)\n            go f()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc f() {\n    // When the termination condition for this goroutine is detected, do:\n    wg.Done()\n}"}

The game is designed to scale, so it will need to act in a cluster. Components are mostly CPU bound, and update to a main server asynchronously, which shares game state with clients. Most computation depends on user input, so these events need to be sent down to individual components (hence bi-directional RPC).\nReasons I like D:\n\nManual memory management\nTemplates/CTFE\nCode safety (@safe, contracts, in/out)\n\nReasons I like Go:\n\nStandard library (pprof, RPC)\nGo routines\ngo tool (esp. go get -u to install/update remote dependencies)\n\nThe client will likely be written in D, but that shouldn't have an impact on the server.\nI am leaning towards D because manual memory management is baked into the language.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm currently in the design stage of writing a utility library that will make interaction with the x-go-binding a bit easier. (I've done this before with Python and xpyb.) For example, it will help with querying information defined in the EWMH spec and binding keys to callback functions. (And much more.) So as my initial idea for a package layout, consider:\n\nxutil\n\newmh\nkeybind\n\n\n\nWhere each is its own package. (Similar to how the standard library's image package is setup.)\nWhat's unique about my situation is that almost every x-go-binding call requires some combination of an xgb connection object or a root window identifier. Therefore, it makes sense to me to store this information in a struct like so:\ntype XUtilConnection struct {\n    conn xgb.Conn\n    root xgb.Id\n    // a few other things, like a mapping of events to callbacks\n}\n\nSo that I'd have a factory that could be used like so:\nxconn = xutil.NewXUtilConnection(blah blah)\n\nAnd it could be used like:\nxconn.get_active_window()\nxconn.bind_key(\"Shift-a\", my_callback_fun)\n\nThere may also be functions like:\nkeybind.get_keycode(\"a\")\newmh.get_atom(\"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW\")\n\nMy problem of course is that receivers, to my knowledge, can only be of types that have been declared in the same package. If I separate my packages, I cannot use my XUtilConnection type as a receiver in any of my sub-packages.\nI suspect that my answer is going to be making this one big package separated into different logical files, but I fear that this might lead to namespace clutter. (For example, implementing the EWMH spec is probably on the order of 100+ functions.)\nI am also aware that I could define a new container type in each sub-package for my XUtilConnection object.

Some of these rules are:\n\n*T: create a new data type that is a pointer to T\n[10]T: an array of Ts\nstruct { t T; u U ... }: a structure which contains a T as a component\n...\n\nThe programmer can create complex data types by composing these simple rules. The total number of possible data types exceeds the number of useful data types. Clearly, there exist (and have to exist) data types which aren't useful at all. This is just a natural consequence of the fact that the rules for building new data types are simple.\nThe type **T falls into the category of types which are less probable to appear in a program. The fact that it is possible to write *****T doesn't imply that such a type has to be immensely useful.\n\nAnd finally, the answer to your question:\nThe type **T usually appears in contexts where we want to redirect users of a value of type T to another value of type T, but for some reason we do not have access to all users of the value or finding the users would cost too much time:\n\nWe do not want to copy values of type T (for some reason)\nWe want all users of a value of type T to access the value via a pointer\nWe want to quickly redirect all users of a particular value of type T to another value\n\nIn such a situation, using **T is natural because it allows us to implement the 3rd step in O(1):\ntype User_of_T struct {\n  Value **T\n}\n\n// Redirect all users of a particular value of type T\n// to another value of type T.\nfunc (u *User_of_T) Redirect(t *T) {\n  *(u.Value) = t\n}"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "Does Google's Golang address the problems with languages addressed in Paul's Graham's post 'Why Arc isn't Especially Object Oriented'?", "output": "My initial feeling towards this is \"It is too soon to tell\"\n\n1) Object-oriented programming is exciting if you have a\n  statically-typed language   without\n  lexical closures or macros. To some\n  degree, it offers a way around these\n  limitations. (See Greenspun's Tenth\n  Rule.)\n\nGo supports Function literals (see docs) which if I am reading this correctly allow you to pass functions as params, whether defined elsewhere or created ad-hoc.\n\n2) Object-oriented programming is popular in big companies, because it\n  suits the way they write software. At\n  big companies, software tends to be\n  written by large (and frequently\n  changing) teams of mediocre\n  programmers. Object-oriented\n  programming imposes a discipline on\n  these programmers that prevents any\n  one of them from doing too much\n  damage. The price is that the\n  resulting code is bloated with\n  protocols and full of duplication.\n  This is not too high a price for big\n  companies, because their software is\n  probably going to be bloated and full\n  of duplication anyway.\n\nThis point is far to subjective to answer.  \n\n3) Object-oriented programming generates a lot of what looks like\n  work. Back in the days of fanfold,\n  there was a type of programmer who\n  would only put five or ten lines of\n  code on a page, preceded by twenty\n  lines of elaborately formatted\n  comments. Object-oriented programming\n  is like crack for these people: it\n  lets you incorporate all this\n  scaffolding right into your source\n  code. Something that a Lisp hacker\n  might handle by pushing a symbol onto\n  a list becomes a whole file of classes\n  and methods. So it is a good tool if\n  you want to convince yourself, or\n  someone else, that you are doing a lot\n  of work.\n\nSince go isn't a truly object oriented language, you can probably solve the problem in whatever fashon you are comfortable with.  \n\n4) If a language is itself an object-oriented program, it can be\n  extended by users. Well, maybe. Or\n  maybe you can do even better by\n  offering the sub-concepts of\n  object-oriented programming a la\n  carte. Overloading, for example, is\n  not intrinsically tied to classes.\n  We'll see.\n\nGo seems to have an interesting approach to objects, where you are not required to worry / develop large object trees.  It looks like the tools are present in the language to structure your data in an object oriented fashion without locking you in to a pure object oriented environment.\n\n5) Object-oriented abstractions map neatly onto the domains of certain\n  specific kinds of programs, like\n  simulations and CAD systems.\n\n..."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "The Go Programming Language Specification says:\n\n3. The iteration order over maps is not specified. [...]\n\nThat's to be expected since a map type can be implemented as a hash table, or as a search tree, or as some other data structure. But how is map actually implemented in Go?\nPut differently, what determines the iteration order of the keys in\nfor k, _ := range m { fmt.Println(k) }\n\nI started wondering about this after I saw that a map with string keys apparently do have a certain iteration order. A program like\npackage main\nimport (\"fmt\"; \"time\"; \"rand\")\n\nfunc main() {\n    rand.Seed(time.Seconds())\n    words := [...]string{\"foo\", \"bar\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"hello\", \"world\",\n        \"0\", \"1\", \"10\", \"100\", \"123\"}\n    stringMap := make(map[string]byte)\n    for i := range rand.Perm(len(words)) {\n        stringMap[words[i]] = byte(rand.Int())\n    }\n    fmt.Print(\"stringMap keys:\")\n    for k, _ := range stringMap { fmt.Print(\" \", k) }\n    fmt.Println()\n}\n\nprints the following on my machine:\nstringMap keys: a c b 100 hello foo bar 10 world 123 1 0\n\nregardless of the insertion order.\nThe equivalent program with a map[byte]byte map also prints the keys in a shuffled order, but here the key order depends on the insertion order.\nHow is all this implemented? Is the map specialized for integers and for strings?", "output": "Map is implemented in Go as a hashmap.\nThe Go run-time uses a common hashmap implementation which is implemented in C. The only implementation differences between map[string]T and map[byte]T are: hash function, equivalence function and copy function.\nUnlike (some) C++ maps, Go maps aren't fully specialized for integers and for strings.\nIn Go release.r60, the iteration order is independent from insertion order as long as there are no key collisions. If there are collisions, iteration order is affected by insertion order. This holds true regardless of key type. There is no difference between keys of type string and keys of type byte in this respect, so it is only a coincidence that your program always printed the string keys in the same order. The iteration order is always the same unless the map is modified.\nHowever, in the newest Go weekly release (and in Go1 which may be expected to be released this month), the iteration order is randomized (it starts at a pseudo-randomly chosen key, and the hashcode computation is seeded with a pseudo-random number). If you compile your program with the weekly release (and with Go1), the iteration order will be different each time you run your program. That said, running your program an infinite number of times probably wouldn't print all possible permutations of the key set. Example outputs:\nstringMap keys: b 0 hello c world 10 1 123 bar foo 100 a\nstringMap keys: hello world c 1 10 bar foo 123 100 a b 0\nstringMap keys: bar foo 123 100 world c 1 10 b 0 hello a\n..."}

It weasels out saying, \"The interpretation of the ImportPath is implementation-dependent.\"  The current implementation behavior was set with CL 5787055, which was subsequently debated at length on Go-nuts.\n\"Local\" means indicated with a file system relative path.  Obviously a relative path starting with .. is local, so the trick is just getting the go command to treat main as a local package as well.  It apparently doesn't do this when you type go build, but does when you type go build main.go."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "The Go language has interface types as features, analogous to C-style interfaces. Go's interface types, though, don't seem to be enforced -- they merely define protocol without actually being applied to a type. As they are not enforced, is it still a good idea to use interfaces?", "output": "Yes. Go doesn't allow you to build type-hierarchies, so interfaces are very important to allow some polymorphism. Consider the sort.Interface defined in the package sort: \ntype Interface interface {\n    // Len is the number of elements in the collection.\n    Len() int\n    // Less returns whether the element with index i should sort\n    // before the element with index j.\n    Less(i, j int) bool\n    // Swap swaps the elements with indexes i and j.\n    Swap(i, j int)\n}\n\nThe sort package contains a function sort(data Interface) that expects any object that implements this interface. Without interfaces, such form of polymorphism would not be possible in go. The fact that you don't have to explicitly annotate that your type implements this interface, is irrelevant.\nThe cool part about go is that you can even implement this interface on primitive types, as long as the type is defined in the same package. So the following code defines a sortable array of integers:\ntype Sequence []int\n\n// Methods required by sort.Interface.\nfunc (s Sequence) Len() int {\n    return len(s)\n}\nfunc (s Sequence) Less(i, j int) bool {\n    return s[i] < s[j]\n}\nfunc (s Sequence) Swap(i, j int) {\n    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]\n}"}

Neither cgo/life nor anything in pkg/runtime demonstrates this behaviour AFAICT.", "output": "I'll assume you mean from C code compiled with gcc?\nIIRC, this either can't be done or can't easily be done using 6g+cgo and friends. Go uses a different calling convention (as well as the segmented stacks and such).\nHowever, you can write C code for [685]c (or even [685]a) and call into go easily using package·function() (you can even call methods IIRC). See the Source of the runtime package for examples.\nUpdate:\nComing back to this question after the update, and giving it some more thought. This can't be done in a standard fashion using 6c or cgo. Especially because the threads are not started by the go runtime, the current implementation would fail. The scheduler would suddenly have a thread under its control that it does not know about; additionally, that thread would be missing some thread-local variables the go runtime uses for managing stacks and some other things. Also, if the go function returns a value (or several) the C code can't access it on the currently supported platforms, as go returns values on the stack (you could access them with assembly though). With these things in mind, I do believe you could still do this using channels. It would require your C code to be a little too intimate with the inner workings of the go runtime, but it would work for a given implementation. While using channels may not be the solution you're looking for, it could possibly fit more nicely with the concepts of Go than callbacks. If your C code reimplemented at least the sending methods in The channel implementation (that code is written for 6c, so it would have to be adapted for gcc most likely, and it calls the go runtime, which we've determined can't be done from a non-go thread), you should be able to lock the channel and push a value to it. The go scheduler can continue to manage it's own threads, but now it can receive data from other threads started in C.\nAdmittedly, it's a hack; I haven't looked close enough, but it would probably take a few other hacks to get it working (I believe the channels themselves maintain a list of the goroutines that are waiting on them [EDIT: confirmed: runtime·ready(gp);], so you'd need something in your go code to wake up the receiving channel or to warranty the go code won't receive on the channel until you've already pushed a value). However, I can't see any reason this can't work, whereas there are definite reasons that running code generated by 6g on a thread created in C can't.\nMy original answer still holds though: barring an addition to the language or runtime, this can't yet be done the way you'd like (I'd love to be proven wrong here)."}

When entering the select, a ready channel (if any) is selected randomly.  Otherwise, the operation blocks until one of the channels is ready.\nI'm not aware of any trivial way to model this channel selection using the Java utilities.

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I am wondering... I have read about Go some time ago and I tried to program something in it. I seems quite interesting. But I have reached handling \"exceptions\" in this language. I have read about their approach and it seems reasonable. I would like to know what are the advantages of the standard exceptional approach over the Go's style? What are the pros and cons?\nEdit To be straight: I do not want to make any holy war about exceptions. I just wonder if this style of handling errors has any advantages? What are actual advantages of this style over standard exceptions? Is it worth wondering at all?", "output": "panic/recover is moral equivalent of try/catch exceptions. There is superficial difference (syntax) and a subtle, but important, difference of intended use.\nThe best explanations of problems with exceptions in general is \"Cleaner, more elegant, wrong\" and that's a good overview of pros/cons of exceptions vs. returning error codes.\nGo designers decided that error handling by returning error codes from functions is the idiomatic Go way and the language supports multiple return values to make it syntactically easy. While panic/recover is provided, the difference is not of functionality but intended use.\nOther languages exposing exceptions promote their use and in practice they are used frequently (sometimes even misused).\nGo discourages the use of panic/recover. You can do it but you're only supposed to do it in very limited scenarios.\nIf you look at Go's own standard library, most uses of panic are for signaling fatal errors, indicating either an internal error (i.e. bug) in the  library code or calling the library with wrong data (e.g. passing non-json data to json decoding functions).\nBut as the article you linked to points out: \"The convention in the Go libraries is that even when a package uses panic internally, its external API still presents explicit error return values.\"\nThis is different from languages like C#, Java, Python or C++, where a lot of standard library code can throw exceptions to signal errors. Those languages want you to use exceptions. Go discourages the use of panic/recover.\nTo summarize:\n\nidiomatic Go style is to use error codes to tell the caller about errors\nuse panic/recover only in rare cases:\n\n\nto \"crash\" your program when encountering internal inconsistency indicating bugs in your code. It's basically a debugging aid.\nif it dramatically simplifies error handling in your code (but if the code is to be used by others, never expose such panics to callers)\n\n\nIn practice the important thing is to use language's idiomatic style. In Go that's returning error codes and avoiding panic/recover. In C# that's using exceptions to signal some of the errors."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I've only been working with Go for a couple of days. I have a small variety of different structure types defined, each of which contains a date.\nSomehow I need to process those structures in date order, but that ordering has to span across the multiple different structure types. In a dynamically typed language like Python, it's easy to just create a hash of all the objects keyed by date (or hash of lists if they're not unique). In C, I can use unions of pointers or void*. But I'm stuck as to how do this in Go.\nI guess I could keep a sorted list of each type and do a manual mergesort as I go. Seems klunky?\nWhat I've read about handling this sort of situation seems to point to using interfaces, but I don't really see how to use them in this situation. \nFor the sake of argument, let's say I have something like:\ntype A struct {\n    Date string\n    Info string\n}\n\ntype B struct {\n    Date string\n    Info int\n}\n\n(Though in practice there are more structures, and they are more complex with multiple fields), and just need to print in date order the contents of an (unsorted) array of each of them. \nIs there some way to create a list (date, pointer) pairs to a non-uniform object type?\n\nPer first suggestion below:\npackage main\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype A struct {\n    Date string\n    Info string\n}\nfunc (x *A) GetDate() string {\n    return x.Date\n}\ntype B struct {\n    Date string\n    Info int\n}\nfunc (x *B) GetDate() string {\n    return x.Date\n}\n\ntype Dater interface {\n    GetDate() string\n}\n\ntype Daters []Dater\nfunc (s Daters) Len() int      { return len(s) }\nfunc (s Daters) Swap(i, j int) { s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i] }\ntype ByDate struct{ Daters }\nfunc (s ByDate) Less(i, j int) bool {\n    return s.Daters[i].GetDate() < s.Daters[j].GetDate()\n}   \n\nfunc main() {\n    // lista and listb are just examples. They really come from elsewhere\n    lista := []A{{\"2012/08/01\", \"one\"}, {\"2012/08/03\", \"three\"}}\n    listb := []B{{\"2012/08/02\", 2}, {\"2012/08/04\", 4}}\n\n    x := make([]Dater, len(lista) + len(listb))\n    index := 0\n    for i := range(lista) {\n        x[index] = &lista[i]\n        index++\n    }\n    for i := range(listb) {\n        x[index] = &listb[i]\n        index++\n    }\n    sort.Sort(ByDate{x})\n    for _,v := range(x) {\n        fmt.Printf(\"%#v\\n\", v)\n    }\n}\n\nThat works!

This location should have underneath it a src directory, and a pkg directory. Your project go will live under src, and pkg is where packages get installed. Having a bin is optional since you can direct the executables to whatever location you want with GOBIN or the -o flag of running go build -o /path/to/bin/hello hello.go\nA generic GOPATH structure might look like this:\nprojects/\n  src/\n    hello/\n      hello.go\n  pkg/\n\nYou would then be able to set GOPATH=/path/to/projects and could build from any location via:\ngo build -o /path/to/bin/hello hello\nAnother alternative to Eclipse is using SublimeText2, which I have found to be excellent, and it is cross-platform just like Eclipse.

First of, we take the initial []byte array representing\n00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca064f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d89b574a864db8345b1b00b5ac00000000000000800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000080020000\n\nThen, we separate out the first half of the array, obtaining:\n00000001c570c4764aadb3f09895619f549000b8b51a789e7f58ea750000709700000000103ca06 4f8c76c390683f8203043e91466a7fcc40e6ebc428fbcc2d8\n\nAfter that, we need to swap some bytes around. We reverse the order of bytes in every slice of 4 bytes, thusly obtaining:\n0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F\n\nAnd that is the array we will be using for calculating the midstate. Now, we need to alter the file hash.go, adding to type Hash interface:\nMidstate() []byte\n\nAnd change the file sha256.go, adding this function:\nfunc (d *digest) Midstate() []byte {\n    var answer []byte\n    for i:=0;i<len(d.h);i++{\n        answer=append(answer[:], Uint322Hex(d.h[i])...)\n    }\n    return answer\n}\n\nWhere Uint322Hex converts an uint32 variable into a []byte variable. Having all that, we can call:\nvar h BitSHA.Hash = BitSHA.New()\nh.Write(Str2Hex(\"0100000076C470C5F0B3AD4A9F619598B80090549E781AB575EA587F977000000000000064A03C10396CC7F820F8830614E94330C4FCA76642BC6E0ED8C2BC8F\"))\nlog.Printf(\"%X\", h.Midstate())\n\nWhere Str2Hex turns a string into []byte. The result is:\n69FC72E76DB0E764615A858F483E3566E42D56B2BC7A03ADCE9492887010EDA8\n\nRemembering the proper answer:\ne772fc6964e7b06d8f855a6166353e48b2562de4ad037abc889294cea8ed1070\n\nWe can compare them:\n69FC72E7 6DB0E764 615A858F 483E3566 E42D56B2 BC7A03AD CE949288 7010EDA8\ne772fc69 64e7b06d 8f855a61 66353e48 b2562de4 ad037abc 889294ce a8ed1070\n\nSo we can see that we just need to swap the bytes around a bit in each slice of 4 bytes and we will have the proper \"midstate\" used by Bitcoin pools and miners (until it will no longer be needed due to being deprecated)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "off-screen rendering to a texture-bound offscreen framebuffer object should be so trivial but I'm having a problem I cannot wrap my head around.\nMy full sample program (2D only for now!) is here:\nhttp://pastebin.com/hSvXzhJT\nSee below for some descriptions.\nI'm creating an rgba texture object 512x512, bind it to an FBO. No depth or other render buffers are needed at this point, strictly 2D.\nThe following extremely simple shaders render to this texture:\nVertex shader:\nvarying vec2 vPos; attribute vec2 aPos;\nvoid main (void) {\n    vPos = (aPos + 1) / 2;\n    gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n\nIn aPos this just gets a VBO containing 4 xy coords for a quad (-1, -1 :: 1, -1 :: 1, 1 :: -1, 1)\nSo although the framebuffer resolution should theoretically by 512x512 obviously the shader renders its \"texture\" onto a \"full-(off)screen quad\", following GLs -1..1 coords paradigm.\nFragment shader:\nvarying vec2 vPos;\nvoid main (void) {\n    gl_FragColor = vec4(0.25, vPos, 1);\n}\n\nSo it sets a fully opaque color with red fixed at 0.25 and green/blue depending on x/y anywhere between 0 and 1.\nAt this point my assumption is that a 512x512 texture is rendered showing only the -1..1 full-(off)screen quad, fragment-shaded for green/blue from 0..1.\nSo this is my off-screen setup. On-screen, I have another real visible full-screen quad with 4 xyz coords { -1, -1, 1 ::: 1, -1, 1 ::: 1, 1, 1 ::: -1, 1, 1 }. Again, for now this is 2D so no matrices and so z is always 1.\nThis quad is drawn by a different shader, simply rendering a given texture, text-book GL-101 style. In my sample program linked above I have a simple boolean toggle doRtt, when this is false (the default), render-to-texture is not performed at all and this shader simply shows uses texture.jpg from the current directory.\nThis doRtt=false mode shows that the second on-screen quad-renderer is \"correct\" for my current requirements and performs the texturing as I want it to: repeated twice vertically and twice horizontally (later will be clamped, repeat is just for testing here), otherwise scaling with NO texture filtering or mipmapping.\nSo no matter how the window (and thus view port) is resized, we always see a full-screen quad with a single texture repeated twice horizontally, twice vertically.\nNow, with doRtt=true, the second shader still does its job but the texture is never fully correctly scaled -- or drawn, this I'm not sure since unfortunately we can't just say \"hey gl save this FBO to disk for debugging purposes\".\nThe RTT shader DOES perform some partial rendering (or maybe a full one, again can't be sure what's happening off-screen...) Especially when you resize the viewport a lot smaller than the default size you see the breaks between the texture repeats, and not all colors to be expected from our very simple RTT fragment shader are indeed shown.\n(A) either: the 512x512 texture is created correctly but not mapped correctly by my code (but then why is with doRtt=false any given texture.jpg file using the exact same simple textured-quad-shader showing just fine?)\n(B) or: the 512x512 texture is not rendered correctly and somehow the rtt frag shader changes its output depending on the window resolution -- but why? The off-screen quad is always at -1..1 for x and y, the vertex shader always maps this to fragment coords 0..1, the RTT texture always stays at 512x512 for this simple test!\nNote, BOTH the off-screen quad AND the on-screen quad never change their coords and are always \"full-screen\" (-1..1 in both dimensions).\nAgain, this should be so simple. What on earth am I missing?\nSpecs: OpenGL 4.2 (but the code doesn't need any 4.2 features obviously!), Nvidia Quadro 5010M, openSuse 12.1 64bit, Golang Weekly 22-Feb-2012.", "output": "First of all - try checking OpenGL errors. Call glGetError() after each OpenGL function. Also you must set correct viewport for drawing. Before drawing to FBO call glViewport(0, 0, 512, 512). Before drawing to screen call glViewport(0, 0, display_width, display_height).\nAlso there is no need to bind rttFrameTex when you are rendering to it using FBO. Binding texture is needed only when you are reading texture in shader."}

This means that any loop that includes a (non-inlined) function\n  call can be pre-empted, allowing other goroutines to run on the same thread.\n\nShort answer\nIt is not blocking on the writes. It is stuck in the infinite loop of processevents.\nThis loop never yields to the scheduler, causing all goroutines to lock indefinitely.\nIf you comment out the call to processevents, you will get results as expected, right until the 100th write. At which point the program panics, because nobody reads from the channel.\nAnother solution is to put a call to runtime.Gosched() in the loop.\nLong answer\nWith Go1.0.2, Go's scheduler works on the principle of Cooperative multitasking.\nThis means that it allocates CPU time to the various goroutines running within a given OS thread by having these routines interact with the scheduler in certain conditions.\nThese 'interactions' occur when certain types of code are executed in a goroutine.\nIn go's case this involves doing some kind of I/O, syscalls or memory allocation (in certain conditions).\nIn the case of an empty loop, no such conditions are ever encountered. The scheduler is therefore never allowed to run its scheduling algorithms for as long as that loop is running. This consequently prevents it from allotting CPU time to other goroutines waiting to be run and the result you observed ensues: You effectively created a deadlock that can not be detected or broken out of by the scheduler.\nThe empty loop is usually never desired in Go and will, in most cases, indicate a bug in the program. If you do need it for whatever reason, you have to manually yield to the scheduler by calling runtime.Gosched() in every iteration.\nfor {\n    runtime.Gosched()\n}\n\nSetting GOMAXPROCS to a value > 1 was mentioned as a solution. While this will get rid of the immediate problem you observed, it will effectively move the problem to a different OS thread, if the scheduler decides to move the looping goroutine to its own OS thread that is. There is no guarantee of this, unless you call runtime.LockOSThread() at the start of the processevents function. Even then, I would still not rely on this approach to be a good solution. Simply calling runtime.Gosched() in the loop itself, will solve all the issues, regardless of which OS thread the goroutine is running in."}

I pass the first two specs, even though Runner doesn't satisfy interface{Max() int} because the dummy type I use to test it does. Likewise, declaring r without a base type causes it to fail all specs.\nIt is obvious why Go would have type assertion between interfaces work on the actual stored type, but it's not what I'm looking for here.

Please do your own profiling.\nMost of the time functions cause a heap allocation (that then subsequently needs to be collected, causing a pause in your application).  So if you're looking up the time frequently, which it sounds like you are, you'll need to use syscall.Gettimeofday() directly (it's the function that the other time functions end up calling anyway).  See the discussion here for more information:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/f2209022f43efcca?pli=1\nThe solution I'm using is to pre-allocate a tv syscall.Timeval, and each time through my inner loop I do this:\nsyscall.Gettimeofday(&tv)\n\nYou can then get the milliseconds with:\n(int64(tv.Sec)*1e3 + int64(tv.Usec)/1e3)\n\nI've found this to perform a lot better than calling time.Nanoseconds() or one of the other higher-level time functions."}

However compiled languages are safer in general because they can catch certain errors at compile time, which is better than, for example, catching a syntax error at runtime.\nWith Go, the compile time is so speedy that whatever program is running your Go code (e.g. a web server) could hypothetically compile the code on-demand if the code has changed, and otherwise use the compiled version. \nActually if you check out Google App Engine and download their dev web server for Go (https://developers.google.com/appengine/) you'll notice that their web server does exactly this.

However, SteveMcQwark makes it clear why this might be a bad idea.\nI think generics would solve this, but I know they're not immediately forthcoming.  Any other ideas?\nThanks!", "output": "If you really want to do generics in Go, you need an interface.  This interface will be implemented by two types, one for teams and one for players.  The score function will take an object of this interface type as an argument and implement the common scoring logic without knowledge of whether it is working with teams or players.  That's the overview.  Here are some details:\nThe method set of the interface will be exactly the functions that the score function will need.  Lets start with two methods it would seem to need,\ntype scoreable interface {\n    stats(scID) StatLine  // get statLine for ID\n    score(scID, int)      // set score for ID\n}\n\nand a generic scoreable ID type,\ntype scID int\n\nThe types that can implement this interface are not TeamID and PlayerID, but types that hold maps of them.  Further, each of these types will need both maps, the StatLine and score maps.  A struct works for this:\ntype teamScores struct {\n    stats map[TeamID]StatLine\n    scores map[TeamID]int\n}\n\nImplementing scoreable then,\nfunc (s *teamScores) stats(id scID) StatLine {\n    return s.stats[TeamID(id)]\n}\n\nfunc (s *teamScores) score(id scID, sc int) {\n    s.scores[TeamID(id)] = sc\n}\n\nWait, you might say.  That type conversion of scID to TeamID.  Is that safe?  Had we might as well just go with the low-enginering approach of not even having TeamID?  Well, it's safe as long as these methods are used sensibly.  The struct teamScores associates a map of TeamIDs with another map of TeamIDs.  Our soon-to-be-written generic function score takes this struct as an argument and thus is given the correct association.  It cannot possibly mix up TeamIDs and PlayerIDs.  That's valuable and in a large enough program can justify this technique.\nDo the same for PlayerID, define a similar struct and add the two methods.  \nWrite the score function once.  Start like this:\nfunc score(s scoreable) {\n    for\n\nOops, we need some way to iterate.  An expedient solution would be to get a list of IDs.  Let's add that method:\ntype scoreable interface {\n    ids() []scID          // get list of all IDs\n    stats(scID) StatLine  // get statLine for ID\n    score(scID, int)      // set score for ID\n}\n\nand an implementation for teamScores:\nfunc (s *teamScores) ids() (a []scID) {\n    for tid := range s.stats {\n        a = append(a, scID(tid))\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nNow where were we?\nfunc score(s scoreable) {\n    // lets say we need some intermediate value\n    sum := make(map[scID]float64)\n    // for each id for which we have a statLine,\n    for _, id := range s.ids() { // note method call\n        // get the statLine\n        stats := s.stats() // method call\n        // compute intermediate value\n        sum[id] = 0.\n        for _, statValue := range stats {\n            sum[id] += statValue\n        }\n    }\n    // now compute the final scores\n    for id, s := range sum {\n        score := int(s) // stub computation\n        s.score(id, score) // method call\n    }\n}\n\nNotice the function takes the interface type scoreable, not pointer to interface like *scoreable.  An interface can hold the pointer type *teamScores. No additional pointer to the interface is appropriate.\nFinally, to call the generic function, we need an object of type teamScores.  You probably already have the league stats, but might not have created the score map yet.  You can do all this at once like this:\nts := &teamScores{\n    stats:  ...your existing map[TeamID]Statline,\n    scores: make(map[TeamID]int),\n}\n\ncall:\nscore(ts)\n\nAnd the team scores will be in ts.scores."}

This is more of an app structure question.  That being said, if you have code that solves the above problems, I would love to see it.  Thanks in advance.", "output": "One of my favorite features of Go is the ability to easily add handlers inside of packages.

For example the products package under github.com/storeski/appengine/products would own any inbound url starting with /products. \nWith this modular approach it is beneficial to store the templates within the products package. If you would like to maintain a consistant base template for the site you can establish a convention where you extend templates/base.html.\nExample\ntemplates/base.html\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>{{.Store.Title}}</title>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"content\">\n      {{template \"content\" .}}\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\ngithub.com/storeski/appengine/products/templates/list.html\n{{define \"content\"}}\n  <h1> Products List </h1>\n{{end}}\n\ngithub.com/storeski/appengine/products/http.go\nfunc init() {\n  http.HandleFunc(\"/products\", listHandler)\n}\n\nvar listTmpl = template.Must(template.ParseFiles(\"templates/base.html\",\n  \"github.com/storeski/appengine/products/templates/list.html\"))\n\nfunc listHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\n  tc := make(map[string]interface{})\n  tc[\"Store\"] = Store\n  tc[\"Products\"] = Products\n\n  if err := listTmpl.Execute(w, tc); err != nil {\n    http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)\n  }\n}\n\nThis approach is very exciting because it makes the sharing of apps/package trivial. If I write a package that handles authentication which takes ownership of the /auth url. Any developer that, then, adds the package to their product root instantly has all of the functionality. All they have to do is create a base template (templates/base.html) and direct their users to /auth."}

This idiom is called COW (copy on write) and is quite common in concurrent software design. It's especially well suited for scenarios with a high read/write ratio (just like a cache).\nSo, whenever you want to modify a cached entry, you basically have to:\n\ncreate a copy of the old cached data, if any.\nmodify the data (after this step, the data should be considered immutable and must not be changed anymore)\nadd / replace the existing element in the cache. You could either use the go-cache library you have pointed out earlier (which is based on locks) for that, or write your own lock-free library that simply swaps the pointers to the data element atomically.\n\nAt this point any goroutine that performs a cache.Get operation will get the new data. Existing goroutines however, might still be reading the old data. So, your program might operate on many different versions of the same data at once.

Each of those have a critical section. Before entering critical section, each routine just do some message sending job. When it enters critical section, I need all other routines must stop execution until it exits critical section. Is it possible by using any library function in GO?\n\nWhat you are asking about (to force a stop on all other goroutines while one goroutine is in the critical section) is not typical in Go programs. There is no library function to stop all other goroutines, so you will need to stop them by designing proper synchronization among goroutines in your program. The typical scenario is for all goroutines to (potentially) run concurrently, except for those goroutines that are blocked somehow.\nTo control concurrent access to a shared resource in a Go program you can use Go channels, the \"sync\" package, pipes, or network connections.\nUsing sync.Mutex, the Go code may look like this (but please keep in mind that, whenever possible, Go programs should preferably use Go channels instead of mutexes):\npackage main\n\nimport \"sync\"\n\nvar m sync.Mutex\nvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\nfunc routine1() {\n    ... do something ...\n\n    m.Lock()\n    ... critical section (access the shared resource here) ...\n    m.Unlock()\n\n    ... do something ...\n    wg.Done()\n}\n\nfunc routine2() {\n    ... do something ...\n\n    m.Lock()\n    ... critical section (access the shared resource here) ...\n    m.Unlock()\n\n    ... do something ...\n    wg.Done()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    wg.Add(1); go routine1()\n    wg.Add(1); go routine2()\n    wg.Wait()\n}"}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "As part of my Go tutorial, I'm writing simple program counting words across multiple files. I have a few go routines for processing files and creating map[string]int telling how many occurrence of particular word have been found. The map is then being sent to reducing routine, which aggregates values to a single map. Sounds pretty straightforward and looks like a perfect (map-reduce) task for Go!\nI have around 10k document with 1.6 million unique words. What I found is my memory usage is growing fast and constantly while running the code and I'm running out of memory at about half way of processing (12GB box, 7GB free). So yes, it uses gigabytes for this small data set!\nTrying to figure out where the problem lies, I found the reducer collecting and aggregating data is to blame. Here comes the code:\nfunc reduceWords (input chan map[string]int, output chan int) {\n  total := make(map[string]int)\n  for wordMap := range input {\n    for w, c := range wordMap {\n      total[w] += c\n    }\n  }      \n  output <- len(total)\n}\n\nIf I remove the map from the sample above the memory stays within reasonable limits (a few hundred megabytes). What I found though, is taking copy of a string also solves the problem, i.e. the following sample doesn't eat up my memory:\nfunc reduceWords (input chan map[string]int, output chan int) {\n  total := make(map[string]int)\n  for wordMap := range input {\n    for w, c := range wordMap {\n      copyW := make([]byte, len(w)) // <-- will put a copy here!\n      copy(copyW, w)\n      total[string(copyW)] += c\n    }\n  }  \n  output <- len(total)\n}\n\nIs it possible it's a wordMap instance not being destructed after every iteration when I use the value directly? (As a C++ programmer I have limited intuition when comes to GC.) Is it desirable behaviour? Am I doing something wrong? Should I be disappointed with Go or rather with myself?\nThanks!", "output": "What does your code look like that turns files into strings?  I would look for a problem there.  If you are converting large blocks (whole files maybe?) to strings, and then slicing those into words, then you are pinning the entire block if you save any one word.

E.g. I end up with SQL akin to the following if the user enters four values:\nSELECT * FROM sky WHERE name IN (?,?,?,?)\n\nSo naturally I would like to call the Exec method with a slice of strings:\nvar values []string = getValuesFromUser()\nstatement := createStatementWithSufficientNumberOfPlaceholders(len(values))\n_ := statement.Exec(values...) // compiler doesn't like this\n\nThis does not compile.

Of course, you'll have to write it again for each []T -> []interface{} conversion you want to do, but its a rather short function, and all that changes is the signature. You could use reflection, which comes with an inherent runtime cost, to make the function \"generic\", such as in:\nvaluesVal := reflect.ValueOf(values)\n...\nfor i := range values2 { values2[i] = valuesVal.Index(i).Interface() }"}

So, from performance viewpoint the decision to disallow function comparisons was a good decision.\n\nIn relation to using the reflect package to determine function identity, a code like\nfunc SomeFun()    {}\nfunc AnotherFun() {}\n\nfunc main() {\n    sf1 := reflect.ValueOf(SomeFun)\n    sf2 := reflect.ValueOf(SomeFun)\n    fmt.Println(sf1.Pointer() == sf2.Pointer())  // Prints true\n\n    af1 := reflect.ValueOf(AnotherFun)\n    fmt.Println(sf1.Pointer() == af1.Pointer())  // Prints false\n}\n\nrelies on undefined behavior. There are no guarantees as to what the program will print. The compiler may decide that it will merge SomeFun and AnotherFun into a single implementation, in which case the 2nd print statement would print true. In fact, there is absolutely no guarantee that the 1st print statement will print true (it may, under some other Go1 compiler and run-time, print false).\n\nA correct answer to your original question is:\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc F1() {}\nfunc F2() {}\n\nvar F1_ID = F1  // Create a *unique* variable for F1\nvar F2_ID = F2  // Create a *unique* variable for F2\n\nfunc main() {\n    f1 := &F1_ID  // Take the address of F1_ID\n    f2 := &F2_ID  // Take the address of F2_ID\n\n    // Compare pointers\n    fmt.Println(f1 == f1)  // Prints true\n    fmt.Println(f1 == f2)  // Prints false\n}"}

If I retrieve the data from the Datastore, change it, and save it back for one instance, another might be wanting to do the same in parallel, and I`m not sure if the final result will be correct.", "output": "It seems like a good way to do that is to simply store all vote events as separate entities (the \"voted for X\" way) and use the Task Queue for the recalculation (the \"12 votes for X, 10 votes for Y\" way), so the recalculation is done offline and sequentially (without any races and other concurrency issues). Then you'd have to put the recalc task every once in a while to the queue so the results are updated.\nThe Task Queue doesn't allow adding another task with the same name as an existing one, but doesn't allow checking whether a specific task is already enqueued, so maybe simply trying adding a task with a same name to the queue will be enough to be sure that multiple recalc tasks are not there.\nAnother way would be to use a goroutine waiting for a poke from an input channel in order to recalculate the results. I haven't run such goroutines on App Engine so I'm not sure of the general behavior of this approach."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "In my C++ project, I have a large, GB binary file on disk that I read into memory for read-only calculations.\nMy current C++ implementation involves reading the entire chunk into memory once and then spawning threads to read from the chunk in order to do various calculations (mutex-free and runs quickly).  Technically, each thread really only needs a small part of the file at a time, so in the future, I may change this implementation to use mmap(), especially if the file gets too big.  I've noticed this gommap lib so I think I should be covered going forward.\nWhat approach should I take to translate my current C++ threading model (one large chunk of read-only memory) into a go threading model, keeping run-time efficiency in mind? \ngoroutines?  alternatives?", "output": "I'm sure this answer will cop a lot of heat but here goes:\nYou won't get reduced running time by switching to Go, especially if your code is already mutex free. Go doesn't guarantee efficient balancing of goroutines, and will not currently make best use of the available cores. The generated code is slower than C++. Go's current strengths are in clean abstractions, and concurrency, not parallelism.\nReading the entire file up front isn't particular efficient if you then have to go and backtrack through memory. Parts of the file you won't use again until much later will be dropped from the cache, only to be reloaded again later. You should consider memory mapping if your platform will allow it, so that pages are loaded from disk as they're required.\nIf there is any intense inter-routine communication, or dependencies between the data you should try to make the algorithm single threaded. It's difficult to say without knowing more about the routines you're applying to the data, but it does sound possible that you've pulled out threads prematurely in the hope to get a magic performance boost.\nIf you're unable to rely on memory mapping due to file size, or other platform constraints, you should consider making use of the pread call, thereby reusing a single file descriptor, and only reading as required.\nAs always, the following rule applies to optimization. You must profile. You must check that changes you make from a working solution, are improving things. Very often you'll find that memory mapping, threading and other shenanigans have no noticeable effect on performance whatsoever. It's also an uphill battle if you're switching away from C or C++.\nAlso, you should spawn goroutines to handle each part of the file, and reduce the results of the calculations through a channel. Make sure to set GOMAXPROCS to an appropriate value."}

How do new languages such as Scala and Go improve concurrency?  How are they more understandable and how do they prevent concurrency bugs? Can someone provide real-world examples that demonstrates the advantages?", "output": "The three main contenders for simplifying concurrency are actors, software transactional memory (STM), and automatic parallelization. Scala has implementations of all three.\nActors\nActors find their most notable implementation in the language Erlang, which as far as I know is where the idea started*. Erlang is designed from the ground up around actors.  The idea is that actors themselves are black boxes to each other; they interact only by passing messages.\nScala has an implementation of actors in its library, and variants are available in external libraries. In the main library, the black-box-ness is not enforced, but there are easy-to-use methods for passing messages, and Scala makes it easy to create immutable messages (so you don't have to worry that you send a message with some content, and then change the content at some random time).\nThe advantage of actors is that you don't have to worry about complex shared state, which really simplifies the reasoning involved.  Also, you can decompose the problem into smaller pieces than threads and let the actor library figure out how to bundle actors into the appropriate number of threads.\nThe downside is that if you are trying to do something complex, you have a lot of logic to deal with for sending messages, handling errors, and so on, before you know it succeeds.\nSoftware Transactional Memory\nSTM is based on the idea that the most important concurrent operation is to grab some shared state, fiddle with it, and write it back.  So it provides a means of doing this; however, if it encounters some problem--which it typically delays detecting until the very end, at which point it checks to make sure the writes all went correctly--it rolls back the changes and returns a failure (or tries again).\nThis is both high-performance (in situations with only moderate contention, since usually everything goes just fine) and robust to most sorts of locking errors, since the STM system can detect problems (and even potentially do things like take access away from a lower-priority request and give it to a higher-priority one).\nUnlike actors, it's easier to attempt complex things, as long as you can handle failure.  However, you also have to reason correctly about the underlying state; STM prevents rare unintentional deadlocks via failing and retrying, but if you've simply made a logic error and a certain set of steps cannot complete, STM cannot allow it to.\nScala has a STM library that is not part of the standard library but is being considered for inclusion.  Clojure and Haskell both have well-developed STM libraries.\nAutomatic Parallelization\nAutomatic parallelization takes the view that you don't want to think about concurrency; you just want stuff to happen fast.  So if you have some sort of parallel operation--applying some complex operation to a collection of items, one at a time, and producing some other collection as a result, for instance--you should have routines that automatically do this in parallel.  Scala's collections can be used in this way (there is a .par method that converts a conventional serial collection into its parallel analog).  Many other languages have similar features (Clojure, Matlab, etc.).\n\nEdit: Actually, the Actor model was described back in 1973 and was probably motivated by earlier work in Simula 67 (using coroutines instead of concurrency); in 1978 came the related Communicating Sequential Processes. So Erlang's capabilities were not unique at the time, but the language was uniquely effective at deploying the actor model."}

We usually don't need to call OpenFile directly.\nNotice treating EOF. Read tries to fill buf on each call, and returns io.EOF as error if it reaches end of file in doing so. In this case buf will still hold data. Consequent calls to Read returns zero as the number of bytes read and same io.EOF as error. Any other error will lead to a panic.\nUsing bufio\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"bufio\"\n    \"io\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // open input file\n    fi, err := os.Open(\"input.txt\")\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n    // close fi on exit and check for its returned error\n    defer func() {\n        if err := fi.Close(); err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n    }()\n    // make a read buffer\n    r := bufio.NewReader(fi)\n\n    // open output file\n    fo, err := os.Create(\"output.txt\")\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n    // close fo on exit and check for its returned error\n    defer func() {\n        if err := fo.Close(); err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n    }()\n    // make a write buffer\n    w := bufio.NewWriter(fo)\n\n    // make a buffer to keep chunks that are read\n    buf := make([]byte, 1024)\n    for {\n        // read a chunk\n        n, err := r.Read(buf)\n        if err != nil && err != io.EOF {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n        if n == 0 {\n            break\n        }\n\n        // write a chunk\n        if _, err := w.Write(buf[:n]); err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n    }\n\n    if err = w.Flush(); err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n}\n\nbufio is just acting as a buffer here, because we don't have much to do with data. In most other situations (specially with text files) bufio is very useful by giving us a nice API for reading and writing easily and flexibly, while it handles buffering behind the scenes.\n\nNote: The following code is for older Go versions (Go 1.15 and before). Things have changed. For the new way, take a look at this answer.\nUsing ioutil\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"io/ioutil\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // read the whole file at once\n    b, err := ioutil.ReadFile(\"input.txt\")\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n\n    // write the whole body at once\n    err = ioutil.WriteFile(\"output.txt\", b, 0644)\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n}\n\nEasy as pie!

Or there is some intrinsic problem with the Go language?\nEDIT:\nMost answers deny intrinsic slowness of Go languge, claiming the problem resides in immature compilers.\nTherefore I've made some own tests to calculate Fibonacci numbers: Iterative algorithm runs in Go (freebsd,6g) with the same speed as in C (with O3 option).

They don't have a huge amount to do with the language as such, except to the extent that the implementation spends runtime supporting language features that the benchmark doesn't really need. In most compiled languages a sufficiently clever compiler could in theory strip out what isn't needed, but there comes a point where you're rigging the demo, since very few real users of the language would write programs that didn't use that feature. Moving things out of the way without removing them entirely (e.g. predicting virtual call destinations in JIT-compiled Java) starts to get tricky.\nFWIW, my own very trivial test with Go when I was taking a look at it (a loop of integer addition, basically), gccgo produced code towards the fast end of the range between gcc -O0 and gcc -O2 for equivalent C. Go isn't inherently slow, but the compilers don't do everything, yet. Hardly surprising for a language that's 10 minutes old."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following programming question.", "input": "I'm trying to get some feedback on the recommendations for a service 'roster' in my specific application. I have a server app that maintains persistant socket connections with clients. I want to further develop the server to support distributed instances. Server \"A\" would need to be able to broadcast data to the other online server instances. Same goes for all other active instances. \nOptions I am trying to research:\n\nRedis / Zookeeper / Doozer - Each server instance would register itself to the configuration server, and all connected servers would receive configuration updates as it changes. What then?\n\nMaintain end-to-end connections with each server instance and iterate over the list with each outgoing data?\nSome custom UDP multicast, but I would need to roll my own added reliability on top of it.\n\nCustom message broker - A service that runs and maintains a registry as each server connects and informs it. Maintains a connection with each server to accept data and re-broadcast it to the other servers.\nSome reliable UDP multicast transport where each server instance just broadcasts directly and no roster is maintained.\n\nHere are my concerns:\n\nI would love to avoid relying on external apps, like zookeeper or doozer but I would use them obviously if its the best solution\nWith a custom message broker, I wouldnt want it to become a bottleneck is throughput. Which would mean I might have to also be able to run multiple message brokers and use a load balancer when scaling?\nmulticast doesnt require any external processes if I manage to roll my own, but otherwise I would need to maybe use ZMQ, which again puts me in the situation of depends.\n\nI realize that I am also talking about message delivery, but it goes hand in hand with the solution I go with. \nBy the way, my server is written in Go. Any ideas on a best recommended way to maintain scalability? \n* EDIT of goal *\nWhat I am really asking is what is the best way to implement broadcasting data between instances of a distributed server given the following:\n\nEach server instance maintains persistent TCP socket connections with its remote clients and passes messages between them.\nMessages need to be able to be broadcasted to the other running instances so they can be delivered to relavant client connections.\nLow latency is important because the messaging can be high speed.\nSequence and reliability is important.\n\n* Updated Question Summary *\nIf you have multiple servers / multiple end points that need to pub/sub between each other, what is a recommended mode of communication between them? One or more message brokers to re-pub messages to a roster of the discovered servers? Reliable multicast directly from each server?\nHow do you connect multiple end points in a distributed system while keeping latency low, speed high, and delivery reliable?", "output": "Assuming all of your client-facing endpoints are on the same LAN (which they can be for the first reasonable step in scaling), reliable UDP multicast would allow you to send published messages directly from the publishing endpoint to any of the endpoints who have clients subscribed to the channel. This also satisfies the low-latency requirement much better than proxying data through a persistent storage layer.\nMulticast groups\n\nA central database (say, Redis) could track a map of multicast groups (IP:PORT) <--> channels.\nWhen an endpoint receives a new client with a new channel to subscribe, it can ask the database for the channel's multicast address and join the multicast group.\n\nReliable UDP multicast\n\nWhen an endpoint receives a published message for a channel, it sends the message to that channel's multicast socket.\nMessage packets will contain ordered identifiers per server per multicast group. If an endpoint receives a message without receiving the previous message from a server, it will send a \"not acknowledged\" message for any messages it missed back to the publishing server.\nThe publishing server tracks a list of recent messages, and resends NAK'd messages.\nTo handle the edge case of a server sending only one message and having it fail to reach a server, server can send a packet count to the multicast group over the lifetime of their NAK queue: \"I've sent 24 messages\", giving other servers a chance to NAK previous messages.\n\nYou might want to just implement PGM.\nPersistent storage\nIf you do end up storing data long-term, storage services can join the multicast groups just like endpoints... but store the messages in a database instead of sending them to clients."}

You can never get an object itself as a value. The is operator compares two values, which are pointers, for pointer equality; whereas the == operator compares two such pointers, for equality of the objects pointed to.\nIn Go, it's a little more complicated. Go has pointers, as well as other non-pointer types (boolean, number types, strings, arrays, slices, structs, functions, interfaces, maps, channels). It doesn't make sense to ask for pointer equality for non-pointer types. (What would it mean? What would it accomplish?)\nSo to have the equivalent situation as Python, let's put all of our values behind pointers, and so all variables are pointers. (There is a convention in many Go libraries of a \"New\" function that creates a pointer type; and the methods also operate on the pointer type; so this is compatible with that convention.) Then (if a and b are pointers) a == b in Go would compare two such pointers for pointer equality; and you can use *a == *b to compare the underlying values, if they are comparable.\nGo also has several non-pointer reference types: slices, maps, functions, and channels. Channels are comparable using == for whether they are the same channel. However, slices, maps, and functions cannot be compared; it may be possible using reflection though."}

Is this even possible with the atomic-package?\n\nNo, that is not possible. Most architectures only support atomic operations on a single word. A lot of academic papers however use more powerful CAS statements (e.g. compare and swap double) that are not available today. Luckily there are a few tricks that are commonly used in such situations:\n\nYou could for example steal a couple of bits from the pointer (especially on 64bit systems) and use them, to encode your counter. Then you could simply use Go's CompareAndSwapPointer, but you need to mask the relevant bits of the pointer before you try to dereference it.\nThe other possibility is to work with pointers to your (immutable!) pointer_t struct. Whenever you want to modify an element from your pointer_t struct, you would have to create a copy, modify the copy and atomically replace the pointer to your struct. This idiom is called COW (copy on write) and works with arbitrary large structures. If you want to use this technique, you would have to change the next attribute to next  *pointer_t.\n\nI have recently written a lock-free list in Go for educational reasons. You can find the (imho well documented) source here: https://github.com/tux21b/goco/blob/master/list.go\nThis rather short example uses atomic.CompareAndSwapPointer excessively and also introduces an atomic type for marked pointers (the MarkAndRef struct).

You can define variables by using the dollar symbol. \nThe following example is not very elegant, but may give you an idea of what is possible. Imagine we have three slices: one with \"User\" objects, one with \"Spot\" objects and one with \"Checkin\" objects. They are all the same length and are related by position (index 0 for each contains the user that was checked in, the spot he/she checked in at, and the checkin object contains the time it happened). \"range\" will give you two variables as it iterates over the slice: index ($i in the example) and the value ($v). Using \"index\" you can ask for an entity in a slice, so {{$user := index $checkinUsers $i}} will give you the object at the position pointed to by $i.\n{{$checkinUsers := .CheckinUsers}}\n{{$checkinSpots := .CheckinSpots}}\n{{range $i, $v := .Checkins}}\n    {{$user := index $checkinUsers $i}}\n    {{$spot := index $checkinSpots $i}}\n    <tr>\n        <td>\n            {{$user.FirstName}} {{$user.LastName}} @ {{$spot.Description}} ({{$v.Time}})<br />\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    {{end}}\n\nAgain, this example isn't very elegant, but I hope you can see that it is possible to make dynamic HTML in Go just as easily as in JSPs (my experience is that the resulting pages are cleaner than JSPs, and thus more understandable by less experienced web-developers and designers). \nEx animo,\n/Alexander Yngling."}
